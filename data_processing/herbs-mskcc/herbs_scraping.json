It was also proposed to potentially reduce hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer or with risk of breast cancer by enhancing serotonin levels (27) , but a clinical study in postmenopausal women found it ineffective (20) .",

An oral agaricus extract improved natural killer cell activity and quality of life in gynecological cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (7). Other preliminary data show that daily intake of agaricus powder improves quality of life among cancer patients in remission (26). Although no survival improvements were reported with an agaricus extract in multiple myeloma patients, immunomodulatory effects were observed (29). However, agaricus extract did not confer any benefits in elderly women (25). Larger studies are needed to resolve the ambiguity.\n\nWhereas a small study reported that agaricus extract may improve liver function in patients with hepatitis B (13), liver damage and deaths (14) along with cheilitis (15) have been reported following consumption. In addition, laboratory samples of agaricus had high levels of inorganic arsenic (31).

ALA is sometimes referred to as a \u201cuniversal antioxidant\u201d because it is both water- and fat-soluble and can neutralize free radicals (26). It is marketed as a dietary supplement for this reason, and is also used as adjuvant therapy for neuropathy and to improve glycemic control. Preclinical studies show that ALA plays a crucial role in energy production, and exerts antioxidant and apoptotic effects (1) (2) (3).",
                    "Studies on ALA in humans have been conducted across various populations. Preliminary data suggest long-term supplementation may help preserve walking ability in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, especially those with less disability at baseline (27). Studies of intravenous and oral forms suggest improved insulin sensitivity, vasodilation, and neuropathy symptoms in diabetic patients (5) (6) (7) (21) (28), although earlier studies to determine its role in reversing neuropathies (8) (9) and liver disease (10) (11) produced mixed results. Data from a double-blind RCT suggest short-term ALA supplementation can be beneficial for idiopathic pain without altering glycemia in patients with normal levels (45), but another trial did not find it helpful for fibromyalgia (46).",
                    "In women with gestational diabetes, oral ALA may improve liver function and glucose metabolism (29). Meta-analyses also suggest ALA supplementation may reduce inflammatory mediators such as CRP, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and improve some glucose and lipid parameters (30) (31) (32) (33) (34), but confirming studies are needed. In other preliminary studies, ALA induced mild weight loss and waist circumference reduction in overweight or obese subjects (23). Long-term use of R-ALA, which has increased bioavailability, produced modest weight loss in overweight/obese adults without significant reductions in triglyceride levels (47).",
                    "In postoperative settings, ALA helped improve wound healing and scarring in women undergoing cesarean section (35), and reduced pain after carpal tunnel decompression (24). In patients with atrial fibrillation, it reduced serum markers of inflammation but not AF recurrence after ablative treatment (25).",

And even though preclinical studies of ALA demonstrate antioxidant properties with efficacy in neurodegenerative models, oral ALA was ineffective in patients with geographic atrophy from advanced macular degeneration (48).",

Preclinical studies indicate that astragalus and its constituents have antioxidant (27), anti-inflammatory (28), and antiviral (29) properties, along with exerting protective effects on the heart (30) (31) (32), kidney (33) (34) (35), bones (36) , and the nervous system (11) (17) (37).",
                    "In small studies involving healthy individuals, astragalus exhibited sodium-excreting properties (8); produced a viral-type immune response (38); and attenuated immunesuppression induced by strenuous physical activity (71). A formula containing astragalus decreased fatigue in athletes (10); reduced diabetic ketoacidosis (39); and as an adjuvant therapy, helped manage fatigue in stroke patients (64). In the injectable form, astragalus may benefit patients with IgA nephropathy (26). In addition, an astragalus-based formula was shown to preserve residual renal function in dialysis patients (40), and to reduce proteinuria associated with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (7). A systematic review reported benefits of astragalus as an adjunctive therapy for short-term reductions of albuminuria, proteinuria, and serum creatinine in patients with diabetic kidney disease (60). Further research is needed to determine long-term safety and efficacy (65).",
                    "Astragalus also showed anticancer effects against gastric (41), colon (42) (43) (44) (45), hepatic (46) and ovarian (59) cancer cells, and concomitant treatment with aldesleukin potentiated tumoricidal activity while decreasing side effects (14). In addition, it enhanced platinum-based chemotherapy (3) and protected against oxaliplatin neurotoxicity (48). Its saponins were shown to reverse fluorouracil-associated toxicity (42) (28), and augmented benefits of vinblastine while reducing its neutropenic and anemic effects (44).\nLimited clinical data suggest astragalus may be useful in managing cancer-related fatigue (22). It has also been associated with prolonged survival times in acute myeloid leukemia patients (47); and may help reverse chemo-induced immunosuppression along with reducing chemo-induced side effects (1) (2). Meta-analyses have shown associations between astragalus and reductions in chemo-induced nausea and vomiting (49), chemo-induced gastrointestinal toxicity (70), and improvements in quality of life in patients with hepatocellular cancers (16). However, the majority of studies included in these analyses were limited by poor methodology. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm the findings (70). Additionally, the injectable forms of astragalus were shown to improve clinical outcomes in liver cancer patients (67); and quality of life in patients with advanced (20) (68) (72) (73) and metastatic cancers (66) (69). Whether orally administered astragalus exerts similar effects is not known.",
                    "Although astragalus is considered generally safe, due to its antioxidant (27) and estrogenic (23) (50) activities, it may interfere with certain chemotherapy drugs and/or affect hormone-sensitive cancers. However, these findings are based on preclinical studies and cannot be extrapolated to clinical recommendations. The physiological concentration used in these studies is unlikely to be achieved in humans, which makes it difficult to predict the downstream effects/interactions."

                    "Polysaccharides, triterpenoid saponins, and flavonoids are the main constituents of astragalus with immunomodulating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects (27) (51). In vitro studies suggest the saponin astragaloside I promotes osteoblastic differentiation by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (36). Cardioprotective effects from astragaloside IV may occur via the notch1/hes1 signaling pathway (30). In addition, it augments fibrinolytic potential via increases in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) synthesis and downregulation of PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) (21). Other anticoagulant activities are attributed to upregulation of KLF2 mRNA expression and inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway (52).",
                    "Polysaccharides isolated from astragalus produce immunomodulating effects via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities (53). In murine models, they reduced colitis via inhibition of NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which decreases inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta (54), and reduced multiorgan iron overload via upregulated hepcidin and IL-6 expression and enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (55). Cardioprotective effects with this constituent were attributed to anti-inflammatory properties and improved balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO (32). In a diabetic rat model, astragalus polysaccharides exerted effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (37). Astragalus was also found to reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines via increasing levels of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells and by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB (61).",
                    "Benefits to counteract memory disorders were seen with astragalus due to its activity as a nerve-growth promoting factor (17) and due to its ability to increase M-cholinergic receptor density in senile rats (11).",
                    "In dialysis patients, an astragalus-based TCM formula enhanced NO production and transforming growth factor beta suppression (40). In IgA nephropathy patients, an astragalus injection decreased Core I \u03b23-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc) gene expression and increased IgA1 O-glycosylation levels (26). In healthy individuals, a sublingual/ingested astragalus root extract produced increases in monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as circulating cytokines levels, and self-reported symptoms similar to viral type immune responses such as fatigue, malaise, and headache (38). In another study, a formula containing astragalus reduced fatigue in athletes by increasing the uptake and utility of oxygen (10).",
                    "Mechanisms by which astragalus and its constituents may exert anticancer effects have also been examined. In human colorectal cancers cell lines, astragalus suppressed chromosome organization, histone modification, and regulation of macromolecule metabolism, as well as several cancer signaling pathways (56). Saponins induced S phase and G2/M arrest and suppressed p21 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activity (42). Modulation of mTOR signaling and COX2 downregulation also occurred, which in turn can reduce VEGF levels to suppress angiogenesis (43). In gastric adenocarcinoma cells, caspase 3 activation, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, cyclin B1, p21 and c-myc regulation, and downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 occurred (41). Combined with vinblastine, saponins boosted downregulation of proangiogenic and proliferative factors while attenuating neutropenia and anemia seen with this chemotherapy (44). In combination with calpain inhibitors, these saponins may also exert more pronounced apoptotic effects (45). Polysaccharides potentiate immune-mediated antitumor activity of interleukin-2 in vitro (13), improve lymphocyte responses, enhance natural killer cell activity, potentiate monocyte activity (14), increase phagocytosis perhaps by regulating tumor necrosis factor production (5), and activate macrophages to release nitric oxie and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which directly blocks growth of breast cancer cells (62). Apoptotic effects by polysaccharides in hepatocellular carcimona cells were attributed to decreased Notch1 expression (46).",
                    "Formononetin derived from astragalus was shown to have estrogen-receptor-modulating effects (50). Angiogenic effects of astragaloside IV appear to be synergized when combined with ferulic acid from Angelica sinsensis (57)."

A meta-analysis demonstrated a small but significant increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death for the beta-carotene arm over placebo (11), whereas other studies reported no such effects (39) nor any benefits of beta-carotene supplementation against cardiovascular disease (12), or its risk factors (13). However, higher intake of fruits and vegetables, but not antioxidant supplements, was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause mortality (44).

Consistent associations between serum beta-carotene levels and risk of developing type 2 diabetes are lacking as well (14) (15).\nAdditional studies have reported serum beta-carotene to be inversely associated with the incidence of cataract formation (16); higher intake of \u03b2-carotene (while avoiding vitamin C supplements) to be associated with lowered risk of acquired hearing loss in women (40); and high dietary intake to have a protective effect on buccal cells from relative telomere length (RTL) shortening (41). Data on the effects of supplementation for preventing cognitive decline are conflicting (17) (50) (51).\n\nEpidemiological associations between beta-carotene and cancer risk are conflicting. Whereas high dietary intake was associated with reduced risk of cervical cancer (1); and limited evidence suggesting an inverse association with overall survival in breast cancer patients (47), high serum levels were correlated with increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer (2), but with reduced risk of aggressive urothelial cell carcinoma (32). Findings of beta-carotene and chemoprevention are inconsistent as well. Consumption of beta carotene, vitamins A, C, fruits and vegetables did not influence the risk of renal cell carcinoma (31); supplementation with antioxidants, beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer, and beta-carotene may actually increase overall mortality (3) (4). Data from large, multi-center trials suggest that supplementation may not lower the risk of prostate cancer (5) (6); and in male smokers over the age 40, it may increase lung cancer incidence (7) (30) (42), regardless of the tar or nicotine content of cigarettes smoked (48). When combined with cigarette smoking, beta-carotene supplements may also reduce the efficacy of cancer therapies, resulting in increased recurrence and mortality (8).

Beta-elemene also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, with reduction in LPS-induced nitric oxide production and prostaglandin E2 by rat peritoneal macrophages (11).\n\nBeta-elemene has been shown to affect cancer cells via different mechanisms. In an in vitro study, following administration of beta-elemene, leukemia cells were arrested in S/G2 phase and underwent apoptosis (2). The antiproliferative effects were dependent on p38 MAPK activation/phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and inhibition of tumor growth of glioblastoma cells (3). Beta-elemene also induced G2/M arrest in lung carcinoma cells and ovarian cancer cells by combined reduction of cell-cycle promoters Cdc2 and cyclin B1, and elevated cell cycle regulators p53 and p27 (4) (5). Derivatives of beta-elemene showed antiproliferative activity in human cervical carcinoma cells through a decrease in cell cycle protein Cyclin D1 and thus cell cycle suppression (14). Furthermore, beta-elemene may enhance the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. In non-small cell lung cancer cells, apoptosis was induced by increased expression of Bax and p-Bcl-2, decreased Bcl-2 and XIAP, and augmented cisplatin-induced increases in caspase activity (6). In another study, apoptosis response to the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel in lung carcinoma cells was enhanced with beta-elemene, through increases in cytochrome c, caspase activity, downregulation of Bcl-2, and altered cell membrane permeability (7). Beta-elemene combined with radiation induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, possibly by sensitizing cancer cells to radiation (8).\n\nAn in vivo study showed that beta-elemene inhibits growth of lung cancer cells, and up-regulates the expression of the tumor suppressor, P53, and the release of exosome (22). Another proposed mechanism is that beta-elemene reverses the resistance of lung cancer cells to cisplatin via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (23)."

The edible fruit is used both as food and in medicine to treat diabetes, cancer, viral infections, and immune disorders. Its bitterness is attributed to the presence of alkaloids, momordicosides, and momordicines. In vitro and animal studies suggest anticancer (1) (2) (3), antiviral (4) (5) (6), antidiabetic (31), and lipid-lowering (7) effects.\n\nData in humans are limited. Although bitter melon may lower blood sugar levels in both pre-diabetic (39) and diabetic patients (8) (40) (43), meta-analyses conclude the evidence is low quality with sparse safety data (44), and that more robust studies are needed (9) (40). Other preliminary data suggest supplementation may improve symptoms in knee osteoarthritis patients (41).

It also reduced insulin resistance by influencing PPAR alpha and gamma expression (16) and by modulating phosphorylation status of insulin receptors and downstream signaling molecules (17). Preventive effects against insulin resistance may also occur via modulation of NF-kappa B and JNK pathways (36).\n\nAnimals fed bitter melon showed lower fatty acid synthase (18). It may affect fat and carbohydrate metabolism by stimulating thyroid hormones and adiponectin, and by enhancing AMPK activity (19). In another study, it prevented inflammation and oxidative stress, modulated mitochondrial activity, suppressed apoptosis activation, and inhibited lipid accumulation during the development of fatty liver (32).",

A triterpene extracted from bitter melon activated PPAR gamma and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (20). Bitter melon juice also caused apoptosis by inducing caspase-3 activation through AMPK in pancreatic cell lines (3). Similar effects were observed with methanol extracts which increased Bax and decreased the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (21) (22). Other studies demonstrated reduction in metastasis via suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymatic activities in lung adenocarcinoma cells (23).

Black cohosh by itself (2) (3) or in combination with other herbs (4) (5) may be effective for menopausal symptoms, although data are conflicting (6) (31) (32) (36) (45) and an older meta analysis cited insufficient evidence to support its use (40). However, a more recent meta-analysis found isopropanolic black cohosh extract, an herbal medicinal product widely used in the EU as nonhormonal therapy, is comparable to low-dose transdermal estradiol or tibolone with a better benefit-risk profile than tibolone (62).\n\nInvestigations of black cohosh for hot flashes due to breast cancer treatment also yielded mixed results (10) (11) (12), but supplementation may be effective for menopausal syndrome induced by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (57). In other studies, black cohosh did not enhance bone density, improve menopausal symptoms, nor improve 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in early postmenopausal women (37), although it has been reported to improve sleep (53).",

Whether it has similar effects in breast cancer patients is not clear, and a retrospective observational study of breast cancer patients found that isopropanolic black cohosh extract enhanced disease-free survival (15).\n\nConcomitant use of black cohosh with prescription medications has been associated with adverse drug reactions, most commonly involving abnormal hepatic function, hepatitis or hepatotoxicity (58). Black cohosh should not be confused with blue cohosh, which has a different medicinal profile. It is also not clear whether or not black cohosh acts as a phytoestrogen.

                    "Boswellic acid, the major constituent of boswellia, is thought to contribute to many of the herb\u2019s pharmacological activities. Preclinical studies show that anti-inflammatory activity occurs via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (2) (3) and cyclooxygenase-1 (35). Boswellic acid also inhibits nuclear transcription factor KappaB (NF-KappaB) signaling, markedly decreasing production of the key proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) (17). Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, it failed to show analgesic or antipyretic effects (16).\n\nResearch on cytotoxic effects of boswellic acid indicates that it induces p21 expression through a p53-independent pathway and causes apoptosis in glioma (4) (6) and leukemia (5) cell lines. A boswellia extract induced apoptosis in a cervical cancer cells by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (18). Other apoptotic mechanisms include early generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species that upregulated time-dependent expression of p53/p21/PUMA (19), inhibition of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), and decreased prostaglandin (PGE2) levels and its downstream targets (37).\n\nA semisynthetic analog of boswellic acid, 3-alpha-Butyryloxy-beta-boswellic acid, demonstrated significant growth inhibition in Ehrlich Ascitic Tumour (EAT), Ehrlich Ascitic Carcinoma (EAC) and Sarcoma-180 tumor models, via NF-KappaB downregulation and induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (27). Acetyl-boswellic acids inhibited topoisomerases by competing with DNA for binding sites (20). Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) inhibited human prostate tumor growth via inhibition of VEGFR2-induced angiogenesis (22). The antiplatelet effects of boswellia gum resin extracts are attributed to inhibition of clotting factors Xa and XIa. (34)."

While metabolic changes such as increased aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis occur in cancerous cells, (8) the role of O3FAs in the pathogenesis or cancer treatment is still under investigation (2). Polyunsaturated O3FAs in flaxseed oil have been shown to decrease levels of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta (9). O3FAs also demonstrated antineoplastic properties by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing protumorigenic prostaglandins (2). Flax oil supplements increased total phospholipid fatty acid content in erythrocytes  (10), but the implication of this finding in cancer treatment is unknown. Flaxseed supplements also inhibited in vitro proliferation of human prostate (11) and breast cancer growth by downregulating growth factors and increasing p53 expression (12). Whole flaxseed contains lignans, phytoestrogens that may also have antineoplastic properties and exert hormonal effects (13).\n\nBudwig believed that combining cottage cheese and flaxseed oil improved availability of essential fatty acids through the plasma membrane, thereby improving aerobic cellular respiration (1). The effect of cottage cheese consumption on the bioavailability of O3FAs has not been studied. Processed fats, saturated fats, animal fats, processed foods, and sugar are prohibited in the Budwig diet because they are thought to interfere with oxygen uptake and cellular respiration. Epidemiological studies show that people who consume lactovegetarian diets have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer compared with non-vegetarians (14) (15), although these studies indicate association rather than causation.\n\nGreater tumor regression was reported in mice treated with trastuzumab therapy plus flax oil compared with those treated with trastuzumab alone (16)."

The regimen consists of a diet that restricts intake of carbohydrates and proteins, and involves the use of supplements. In addition, supplementation with Superoxide Dismutase, curcumin, parsley, quercetin, lycopene, Vitamin D and green tea extract is encouraged. (See individual monographs for more information about those supplements.) The protocol is meant to be maintained for six to nine months as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy and radiation.

It helps maintain bone structure and plays an important role in cell signaling and muscle contraction. Dietary sources of calcium include dairy products, dark greens, legumes, nuts and fish. Natural supplements are derived from minerals, oyster shells and occasionally corals.",
                    "Calcium has been studied for a range of conditions including cardiovascular disease (1) (2) (3) (4) (5), osteoporosis (6), bone density loss (7), fracture prevention (8), premenstrual syndrome (9), pre-eclampsia (10) (11) (87), lead poisoning (12), and various cancers (13) (14) (15).",
                    "Long-term supplement use was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery calcification (77) and may lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1) (2) (3) (5), although findings remain debatable (16) (17) (18). In a Women\u2019s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and hormone therapy yielded greater reductions in LDL-C than either intervention alone or placebo (81) but supplementation did not always modify the effects of hormonal therapy on CVD events (88). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may also benefit postmenopausal women who do not have pre-existing risk factors such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension (19); and large long-term studies in women did not find adverse cardiovascular associations with calcium supplementation (4) (20), but a meta analysis reported an increase in the risk of CVD (94). High intake of supplements also increased cardiovascular mortality in men (21). Another study found supplementation to be associated with dementia in women following stroke (75), but dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium were reported useful in maintaining cognitive performance in older females  (90).",
                    "There is also conflicting evidence surrounding the benefits of calcium or calcium plus vitamin D supplements for bone health (22) (23) (24) (42) (53) (82). The US Preventive Services Task Force did not find any associations between calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults without known deficiencies, osteoporosis, or history of fracture (83) (84). In postmenopausal women, neither dietary calcium (25) nor calcium plus vitamin D supplements (26) reduced risk of hip fracture, although the latter study found significant reductions at 7 years (27). Subgroup analysis further suggested that supplementation along with estrogen therapy conferred additive protection against hip fractures (28). However, there appear to be no preventive benefits with supplementation for bone mineral density loss in breast cancer patients (7), in older adults (78), or in healthy men (79). But in a study of pediatric cancer survivors, hypocalcemia induced by standard osteoporotic medication was treated with continuous calcium supplementation (91). Calcium plus vitamin D also reduced bone density loss associated with antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients (72) (92).",
                    "In cancer settings, both dietary and supplemental calcium were linked with lower risk of colorectal cancer (13) (29) (93), with dietary calcium more beneficial in reducing the risk of incidence and recurrence of colorectal and advanced adenomas (95). Calcium intake was associated with increased risk for prostate cancer (30) (31); notably a genetic disposition for high intestinal absorption of calcium was reported in African-American men (32) (33). Long-term studies suggest risks associated with calcium in prostate cancers are less strong when phosphorus intake is also considered (34) (35).",

In adults with normal calcium levels, genetic predisposition to higher serum levels does not affect bone mineral density nor protect against fractures (89). Intake of high-dose calcium supplements (>1 g/day) may actually increase the risk of ischemic stroke (76), and calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may elevate the risk for kidney stones (42) (48) (53) (84)."

Reduced dietary intake may cause calcium depletion in membrane storage sites decreasing stability of vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, as optimal concentrations stabilize these membranes, inhibit calcium entry into cells, and reduce vasoconstriction (47). Gastrointestinal events associated with calcium supplements may also account for an increase in self-reported cardiovascular events (18).",

Saturated fat in whole dairy correlating with higher C-peptide concentrations, along with obesity and hyper-insulinemia, are proposed for associating whole milk with fatal prostate cancer (31). Other suggested mechanisms include increasing levels of ionized calcium in the blood, as prostate cancer cells express both calcium-sensing receptors and calcium-dependent voltage-gated channels, the stimulation of which by extracellular calcium increases prostate cancer cell growth (44) (35).

                "clinical_summary": [
                    "Cannabis sativa is an annual flowering herb native to East Asia, but is now cultivated around the world. Its uses as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, and as a recreational agent date back thousands of years across cultures. It has also been employed in traditional medicine as an analgesic, hypnotic, and hallucinogenic, as a sedative, and for reducing inflammation. Preparations containing flowers (marijuana) and leaves; hashish derived from the resinous extract of the plant are consumed orally; by smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes, or \u201cblunts\u201d (cannabis rolled in the tobacco-leaf wrapper from a cigar); or by vaporizing. Cannabis tinctures, teas, ointments, and oil-based extracts that can be mixed into food products are also popular. It is currently the most widely used illicit agent by more than 147 million people worldwide (1), and the common route of consumption is via inhalation. Because of the potential for high abuse and dependence, and its classification as a Schedule I agent by the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, cannabis use is a controversial subject in the US.",
                    "Pharmacologic investigations over the last few decades revealed cannabinoids (terpenoids) to be the active constituents. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chief psychoactive component whereas cannabidiol (CBD) is a major secondary non-psychoactive cannabinoid, and may modulate the effects of THC. It has antipsychotic, anticonvulsive, and anxiolytic effects. When co-administered, CBD was reported to mitigate the adverse psychotropic and cardiovascular effects associated with THC (2).",
                    "Small studies have evaluated cannabis for its utility in treating pain, symptoms of neurological disorders, AIDS and cancer.\nA systematic review of 18 trials (766 subjects) reported significant relief from pain due to neuropathy, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed chronic pain following cannabinoid use compared to placebo. The interventions included smoked cannabis, oromucosal extracts of cannabis-based medicine, synthetic THC agents dronabinol, nabilone (FDA approved), and a novel THC analogue (3). But a 4-year prospective study involving 1,514 patients with chronic non-cancer pain did not find evidence that cannabis use decreased pain severity or interference, or exerted an opioid-sparing effect (4).",
                    "In a Cochrane review of four trials involving 48 epileptic patients, short-term CBD use was reported to be well tolerated with no adverse effects, but limited evidence precluded definitive conclusions to be reached on efficacy (5). Newer randomized studies of patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, both rare forms of epilepsy, reported effectiveness of Epidiolex, an oral CBD solution, for reducing the frequency of seizures (6). This is now an FDA-approved drug (7). Additionally, data indicate benefits of cannabinoids for treating spasticity and neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (8). The American Academy of Neurology issued a Summary of Systematic Reviews for Clinicians indicating that oral cannabis extract is effective in reducing patient-reported spasticity scores and central pain or painful spasms associated with MS (9).",
                    "Conclusions from a large, comprehensive review of 79 trials (6462 subjects) indicate low-quality evidence to address weight gain from HIV infection, sleep disorders, increasing appetite, and for Tourette syndrome, along with elevated risk of short-term adverse effects (10). The evidence for recommending cannabinoids to treat symptoms of dyskinesia, Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and addiction has been deemed unavailable or insufficient (11).",
                    "In oncologic settings, preclinical findings from 34 studies suggest selective cytotoxic effects of cannabinoids against glioma cells (sparing normal brain cells) via apoptosis, toxicity, autophagy and necrosis (12). A clinical study of 9 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme receiving chemotherapy did not find any benefit with intratumoral THC, but it was well tolerated (13). Data from another study involving 21 glioblastoma patients, in which oromucosal whole plant extract nabiximols (contains THC +CBD) was used, have yet to be published (14). In addition, a cannabinoid resin extract was reported to affect dose-dependent disease control in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20).  But a retrospective observational study showed that concomitant use of cannabis during immunotherapy with nivolumab was associated with reduction in tumor response rate in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal clear cell carcinoma. Progression-free survival and overall survival remained unaffected (21).",
                    "For symptom management, systematic reviews (10) (15) show that patients who used cannabis-based products experienced less chemo-induced nausea and vomiting compared to those on placebo group or on antiemetics. The differences were not statistically significant and adverse effects including \u201cfeeling high,\u201d dizziness, sedation, and dysphoria were reported, resulting in a high dropout rate.  Noteworthy are the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines on antiemetics that recommend dronabinol and nabilone for nausea and vomiting, which is resistant to standard therapy (16).",
                    "Findings on effectiveness of cannabis against cancer pain are encouraging. Data from four trials indicate reductions in pain with orally administered THC and with nabiximols spray in advanced cancer patients (17). An earlier review concluded the evidence level of cannabinoids for alleviating cancer pain as moderate (10). Cannabis has also been investigated for its role in ameliorating cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS), but neither cannabis extract nor THC were found effective in improving symptoms or quality of life in a randomized trial of patients with advanced cancer (18). Additional case reports suggest that dronabinol may be useful for managing persistent symptomatic paraneoplastic night sweats in cancer patients (19). In a randomized uncontrolled study, THC-containing medicinal cannabis was found to improve sleep, functional well-being, and quality of life in patients with high grade gliomas (67).",
                    "Although some data suggest potential benefits, cannabis remains a contentious issue because non-medical use is associated with high risk of addiction, especially when used from an early age (22) (23); dependence (24); adverse effects (25); and with withdrawal syndrome (irritability, sleeping difficulties, dysphoria, craving, and anxiety) (26) that makes cessation tough, eventually leading to relapse. Cannabis use was also reported to elevate the risk of creating false memories (62).\n\nRecent studies suggest utility of nicotine patch in decreasing negative affect-related withdrawal symptoms in individuals with cannabis use disorder (63); and in patients with cannabis dependence, nabiximols combined with psychosocial interventions reduced cannabis use (58). However, an incentive-based intervention was ineffective in individuals with early psychosis and problematic cannabis use (59).",
                    "It is also important to note that synthetic cannabinoid drugs cause more serious adverse effects compared to natural cannabis, and include respiratory difficulties, hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain, muscle twitches, acute renal failure, anxiety, agitation, psychosis, suicidal ideation and cognitive impairment (27).",
                    "Despite the controversy surrounding cannabis use, California became the first state to legalize it for \u201cmedical use\u201d in 1996. As of May 2021, it is available in 35 more states and the District of Columbia (DC) as a medicinal agent, with 16 states and DC also allowing recreational use. Current indications that qualify for medical cannabis use include cancer symptoms, non-cancer pain, glaucoma, AIDS, epilepsy, and MS. However, cannabis use remains illegal under federal law. Following a review of available scientific evidence, the Institute of Medicine (28), and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend that further research be done to develop a comprehensive understanding of the health effects of cannabis (11), which can inform medical cannabis policy. Barriers to research include regulatory issues that involve the FDA, Drug Enforcement Administration, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Institutional Review Boards; procuring cannabis for studies; and methodological challenges of establishing an acceptable route of administration and standardized doses (29)."

                    "Cannabinoids are the active constituents that mimic endogenous cannabinoids, and their activity is based on a receptor-mediated mechanism. THC exerts psychoactive and pain-relieving effects by acting as a partial agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 (predominantly expressed in the central nervous system) and CB2 (associated with the immune system). CB1 and CB2 are members of the G protein-coupled receptors (30), and are activated through inhibition of adenylate-cyclase. The activation in turn inhibits the release of neurotransmitters acetylcholine and glutamate, while indirectly affecting opioid and serotonin receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methly-D-asparate (31). The antiemetic effect of nabilone is due to its ability to activate CB receptors in the brain, which mediate nausea and vomiting (32).",
                    "Mechanisms by which CBD exerts its effects include activation of the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A (33); inhibition of reuptake and/or metabolism of anandamide, an endocannabinoid; activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) channels; inhibition of adenosine reuptake; agonism of PPAR-gamma receptors; by intracellular increase in calcium ions; as well as via anti-oxidative activity (34).",
                    "After inhalation of cannabis, THC is detectable in plasma within seconds, with peak plasma concentration achieved within 3-10 minutes. The bioavailability of THC varies and depends on the depth of inhalation, puff duration, and breath-hold. The systemic bioavailability is estimated to be \u223c23-27% for heavy users; and 10-14% for occasional users. \nFollowing onset of smoking (cigarette containing 15.8 or 33.8 mg THC), the maximum THC plasma concentration (84.3 and 162.2 ng/mL) is attained at about 8 minutes and within 3-4 hours, falls rapidly to 1-4 ng/mL (35).\nWhen compared to smoking and inhalation, systemic absorption following oral ingestion was slower, with maximum plasma concentration (4.4-11 ng/mL for 20 mg; and 2.7-6.3 ng/mL for 15 mg) of THC attained in 1-2 hours.  Substantial metabolism in the liver, via microsomal hydroxylation and oxidation catalyzed by enzymes of cytochrome P450 complex, likely lowers oral bioavailability of THC by 4-12%.\nMuch of the cannabis (80-90%) is excreted within 5 days in the form of hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites (more than 65% of cannabis is excreted in the feces, with about 20% in urine). It is also important to note that residual THC levels have a half-life of 1.3 days in infrequent users compared to 5-13 days in frequent users (36).",
                    "Data on cannabidiol indicate the half-life to be between 1.4 and 10.9 h following oromucosal spray; 2\u20135 days following chronic oral administration; 24 h following intravenous administration; and 31 h following smoking. Bioavailability after smoking was 31%, but has yet to be determined with other routes.

A recent systematic review cites some benefit for both postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy over controls. However, the patch is best used when other therapies have failed due to the small number of patients who may benefit (1 in 8) and unknown risks (10). Low-concentration capsaicin was determined as unlikely to have meaningful use for these conditions in clinical practice (11).

Alternatively, the co-carcinogenic effect of capsaicin on chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis is mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not TRPV1 (18). Further exploration of caspaicin-induced apoptosis, in glioma cells, found inhibition of autophagy to be a likely contributor (34). Interestingly, capsaicin was also shown to induce autophagy by enhancing the levels of autophagy markers LC3-II and Atg5, increasing p62 and Fap-1 degradation and increasing caspase-3 activity to induce apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (41)."

L-carnitine also demonstrated benefits against fatigue both in younger hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine and thyroid cancer patients who have hypothyroidism post-surgery (41). However, carnitine did not improve fatigue in patients with invasive malignancies (28). In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, lenvatinib therapy affected the carnitine system, which may result in carnitine insufficiency to increase fatigue (58).

L-carnitine plays a role in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating beta-oxidation of fatty acids and acting as an intracellular energy reservoir of acetyl groups. In deficiencies, these acyl esters accumulate and cause deleterious effects including inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase, which impedes ATP production (5). Carnitine supplementation prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). L-carnitine may protect against statin-induced cellular damage via antioxidative properties in rat hepatocytes (31).",

Effects on congestive heart failure-associated myopathy may be due to caspase inhibition and decreased TNF-alpha levels (14). Metabolism of dietary L-carnitine by intestinal microbiota produced trimethylamine-N-oxide, a proatherogenic species, which accelerated atherosclerosis (30). Anticatabolic effects may occur by improving nitrogen balance either via increased protein synthesis or reduced protein degradation. Other studies show it prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). Carnitine is often proposed for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, and increased storage in the body tissues (49).

Potential thermogenic effects also involve TRPV1-receptor activation on vagal afferents in the gut (4). Capsaicin may induce energy expenditure by enhancing core body and skin temperature and influencing substrate oxidation, but these effects can vary with body composition (3) (5).

Both are precursors for other hormones, including estrogen and androgens (1). Animal studies indicate that DHEA may have chemopreventive effects (2) (3); blocks the development of tumors (4); and enhances immune response following hepatitis (5) and influenza (6) vaccinations. Although it has been postulated that DHEA may play a role in increasing immune response in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (7), no antiviral or immunostimulatory effects were observed in HIV-positive participants receiving DHEA (8).\n\nIn clinical trials, DHEA was shown effective in treating Addison\u2019s disease (13) (14) (15) (16) (17), major depression (9), schizophrenia-induced anxiety (10), systematic lupus erythematosus (11), erectile dysfunction (13) and osteoporosis (12). Additionally, low serum DHEA-S levels were reported to indicate risk of non-vertebral fractures in older men (47). Topical application of DHEA in postmenopausal women resulted in increased sebum production and epidermal thickening in the hands and face (18). However, DHEA was reported ineffective in treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease (19), obesity in adolescents (20), or perimenopausal symptoms (21). Furthermore, it did not increase muscle mass (22) or physical performance (23), improve cognitive performance (25) , nor enhance insulin secretion or action (24) in elderly individuals; and supplementation with DHEA, believed to enhance physical strength, did not improve physical performance or quality of life in a study done in older men and women (26). Conflicting data, however, suggest improvements in cognitive (43) and physical function (44) in older women. Findings also suggest that DHEA may protect against hypoglycemia-associated neuroendocrine and autonomic failure (48).\n\nIn  addition, DHEA has been studied for its effects on sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women with mixed findings (28) (29). But vaginal use of DHEA may be useful against moderate to severe dyspareunia in menopausal women (49), along with conferring positive effects on vaginal cytology in postmenopausal women with breast or gynecologic cancers (50). Whether or not DHEA is effective for treating adrenal insufficiency remains unclear (41) (42).",

                    "DHEA is an endogenous hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropin. DHEA is metabolized into androstenedione in the body and may be further converted into either testosterone or estrogen. Low levels of endogenous DHEA have been associated with the following disease states: burn trauma, coronary artery disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obsessive-compulsive disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (5). Endogenous DHEA concentration peaks around 20 years of age and declines with age.\n\nDHEA has been shown to stimulate insulin growth factor-1 (1). G6PD is necessary for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production. DHEA has also been shown to increase levels of interleukin-2 in animal models (7). DHEA reduces the effects of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, which are thought to reduce flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (11). Numerous studies have reported an inverse relationship between DHEA concentration and cardiovascular disease (5). DHEA administration improved mental function scores in patients with advanced HIV infection (32), enhanced influenza vaccination in elderly patients (6), and decreased oxidative stress markers in patients with type II diabetes in part by negatively influencing TNF-alpha signaling (33). Although DHEA-S concentration does not appear to be correlated with cognitive decline in aging men (34), the anti-depressive effects of DHEA may be mediated by GABAA receptor modulation (35). DHEA has also been shown to affect cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver (3). The exact effect that this will have on other drugs remains unclear.\n\nAnalogs of DHEA that cannot be converted to androgens and estrogens have been developed and have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects (7) (31). DHEA inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in vitro and blocks the development of tumors in mice (4). It was also shown to induce authophagic cell death in human hepatoma cells via a mitogen activated protein kinase (JNK)-transciption factor (Nrf2)-protein complex p62 axis (46).But an increase in concentration of sex hormones including DHEA has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer (30). And prolonged intake of DHEA in postmenopausal women may increase the risk of breast cancer particularly in obese subjects (36).

                    "Di Bella multitherapy, a questionable alternative therapy, consists of somatostatin, melatonin, bromocriptine, a solution of retinoids, and low doses of cyclophosphamide or hydroxyurea. Physiologist Luigi Di Bella developed the regimen and promotes it as an effective treatment for cancer, retinitis pigmentosa, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Treatment is tailored to the individual patient, and purportedly stimulates the body\u2019s self-healing without the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy.\n\nDi Bella multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth. Somatostatin and its analog octreotide inhibit the secretion of GH and IGF-1 in humans (1), while bromocriptine is a prolactin inhibitor (6). This treatment was very popular in Italy in the late 1990s as Di Bella claimed he cured thousands on an outpatient basis and physicians in other countries such as Canada also prescribed it. The treatment was also highly publicized and politicized in Italy, raising the issue of \u201cfreedom of treatment\u201d for patients who could not afford the expensive regimen. In response, local judges ordered that somatostatin be added to the list of effective reimbursable medications (21) (22), and the Italian National Institute of Health supported 11 separate open-label uncontrolled phase II studies of 8 different cancers, organized by Di Bella and the National Cancer Advisory Committee (20). These trials found no complete responses (23) (24), 0.8% partial response rate, and considerable toxicity (12) (18). However, an uncontrolled study of 20 patients with late stage non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma had a 70% response rate with a similar regimen (6).",

The following components have been studied, but their combined activities and at the Di Bella doses are unknown.\n\nSomatostatin inhibits growth hormone (GH) secretion. Its synthetic analog, octreotide, shows antineoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo, and is used clinically for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. Their biological effects are mediated via high affinity plasma membrane receptors that are found throughout the body and on many human tumors. Clinical studies show a reduction in serum IGF-1 and IGF-1 gene expression after treatment with octreotide (1). Somatostatin and analogs also enhance secretion and expression of IGF-binding protein-1, which negatively regulates plasma IGF-1, while inhibiting mitogens and secretion of gastrointestinal hormones implicated in tumor growth. Somatostatin analogs also show immune-modulating activity in vitro and inhibit angiogenesis and directly induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro (7).\n\nMelatonin is a free-radical scavenger and displays anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro, but no human studies show evidence of anti-tumor activity. Melatonin shows antimyelodysplastic activity and reduces bone marrow toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in animal models. See melatonin for additional information (2) (3) (4) (5).\n\nBromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and prolactin inhibitor. Prolactin stimulates growth of lymphomas in vivo and in vitro, and prolactin receptors are present on normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells.",

SOX9 is a protein involved in the establishment and maintenance of the phenotype of chondrocytes  (35). Dong quai polysaccharides demonstrated anti-osteoarthritic activity by stimulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF1 receptor gene expression, thereby promoting UDP-sugars and glycosaminoglycan synthesis (37). Another compound promotes wound healing and bone regeneration by inducing osteoblast proliferation and hyaluronic acid deposition (25).\n\nAn aqueous extract from dong quai showed estrogen-agonist activity, and stimulated proliferation of both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cells (17). It also protected against radiation-induced pneumonitis by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 in a murine model (14). Subcutaneous injection of dong quai extract protected mice against cyclophosphamide-induced cytotoxicity by promoting recovery from leukopenia (12). The antitumor effects of dong quai may be due to its inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells (9) and by suppression of tumor growth (7) (8) (10) that may be mediated by Nur77-dependent apoptosis (23) (24). However, dong quai extracts also promoted angiogenesis \u2013 which plays a key role in both physiologic and disease processes \u2013 by inducing proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by upregulating VEGF expression (26)."

Extracts derived from the root and aerial parts are widely used in Europe and the United States as nonspecific immunostimulants and to prevent or treat the common cold and influenza. However, natural products differ greatly in composition (26), mainly due to the use of different species, variable plant materials or extraction methods, and the addition of other components. Preclinical studies suggest immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects (27). A standardized echinacea preparation inactivated influenza viruses (28) and may improve respiratory activity (2) (3). In animal models, echinacea stimulated erythropoiesis, increased blood-oxygen transport (29) (30), produced anxiolytic effects (31), and exhibited wound-healing properties (32) (33) (34).",

Studies of its ability to reduce incidence and duration of the common cold yielded mixed results (7) (8) (9) (10) (22) (35) (36). Other analyses do not indicate any benefits for treating colds, and weak evidence for a prophylactic benefit (26) (37), but a large randomized trial found an echinacea formulation to be as effective as oseltamivir for influenza, and with fewer adverse events in the echinacea group (38). In a review of 17 clinical trials involving 3,363 participants, echinacea supplements were found to affect reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (68).\nSmall studies have shown that a standardized echinacea root extract has immunomodulating activity (39); an echinacea/sage spray was useful in treating acute sore throats (17); and a formula containing dry root extracts of Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia may be useful as an adjuvant therapy for decreasing relapse incidence in patients treated for genital condylomatosis (67). Preliminary data suggest anxiolytic effects (69) but findings on improving or enhancing athletic performance are mixed (40) (41). A topical echinacea extract was reported effective in alleviating symptoms associated with atopic eczema (63). Echinacea may also have anticancer potential evidenced by the cytotoxic effects exerted by an extract and a major compound, cichoric acid, in human colon cancer cells (42).",

Immunemodulation by alkylamides occurs through binding to human cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and by inhibiting TNF-alpha (48). Alkylamides may also be responsible for anti-inflammatory effects (27).

However, their effects on innate immunity such as phagocytosis could not be confirmed, and showed only minimal effects on tumor progression, although echinacea did stimulate natural killer cell activity (50).

                    "Elderberry belongs to a family of flowering shrubs known as Sambucus or Elder. They are native to Europe but have become naturalized in many parts of the world including the United States. Cultivated for medicinal and food purposes, the fruit is used to produce jams, syrups, and wine. Elderberry flowers and fruit are incorporated in remedies to reduce cold and flu symptoms, for inflammation and respiratory diseases (1) (2) (3), and to relieve constipation (4). The berries are a rich source of anthocyanins and other phenolics and nutrients (2). Several species of Sambucus produce elderberries with similar chemical compositions including American Elder (Sambucus canadensis) and Blue Elder (Sambucus caerulea) (1), but European Elder (Sambucus nigra) is the type most studied and used in supplements.",
                    "In vitro studies demonstrate that elderberries possess antiviral (5), antibacterial (3), antidiabetic (6), immunomodulatory (7), antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties (1) (2) (8), although inhibition of cancer cell growth was shown to be weak (9). Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins were shown to block HIV1 infection, and may have additive effects with existing AIDS drugs such as enfuvirtide (10). Elderberry also conferred protective effects against oxidative stressors in endothelial cells (8). However, it did not demonstrate vasoprotective effects (11), and randomized trials found it ineffective in improving cardiovascular disease biomarkers (12) or for improving cholesterol levels (13). Small studies found elderberry to be safe and effective in a preparation for chronic constipation (4) and in reducing episodes of tonsillitis in children (33). It may also help reduce symptoms of influenza (14) (28) (34) (35), but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings (32).",

Elderberry\u2019s anti-inflammatory effects may result from increased cytokine production (19) or inhibition of nuclear transcription factor kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (20). An elderberry extract improved metabolic disturbances in a murine model of obesity by lowering serum triglycerides, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance (30). Its antidiabetic properties occur via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and stimulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake (6). Elderberry may also influence HDL dysfunction associated with chronic inflammation by affecting hepatic gene expression in hyperlipidemic mice (31).

However, other studies have attributed estrogen-like activity to icariin derivatives icaritin and desmethylicaritin, rather than icariin itself (14). Icariin can also exhibit a mild phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition effect (16). It has been implicated in differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes via cell cycle regulation, induction of apoptosis, modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, and the regulation of various signaling pathways (17). In undifferentiated neuronal cell lines, it exhibited neuroprotective effects through LDH leakage attenuation which reduced GSH depletion, prevented DNA oxidation damage, and inhibited caspase-3 and p53 activation; and inhibited JNK/p38 MAPK pathways (4).

Its radiosensitizing effects suggest ERK1/2 and AKT pathway suppression, enhanced apoptosis, and induced G2/M blockage (11). Also, icaritin may reverse doxorubicin resistance in human hepatoma cells by increasing intracellular drug accumulation, and by decreasing MDR1 and P-glycoprotein expression (12).

Evening primrose oil may improve quality of life and decrease hot flash intensity in menopausal women (44), although other data suggest that behavioral/lifestyle approaches such as exercise provide better relief (28). In postmenopausal women, it improved related psychological symptoms (55), but more study is needed to confirm these effects.",

Although evening primrose oil does not have intrinsic estrogenic properties, some commercial products combine evening primrose oil with phytoestrogens. Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution."

Folic acid and the L-methylfolate derivative are synthetic supplemental forms that have higher bioavailability (1). Folate is important for cell growth and division, and is involved in methylation and DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake can cause deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia.",
                    "Folate is essential during pregnancy, with supplementation shown to reduce risks of neural tube birth defects (10) and medulloblastoma in offspring (11). A study among South American populations suggests the protective effect against neural tube defects may be greater in female than male infants (65). In high doses (5 mg/day), it reduced homocysteine levels at time of delivery and may lessen pregnancy complications (43). Supplementation may also benefit women with polycystic ovary syndrome (42), but supplements taken beyond the first trimester did not prevent pre-eclampsia in women at high risk for this disorder (72). In a large multicenter trial, folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners of couples seeking infertility treatment did not improve semen quality or live birth rates (81).",
                    "In older adults, folic acid supplementation may improve cognitive function (26). In patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it improved response to cholinesterase inhibitors (27), cognition, and inflammatory markers (46). However, high folate / low vitamin B-12 status has been associated with impaired cognitive function in older adults (82). And although folic acid along with docosahexaenoic acid improved cognitive function and decreased plasma inflammatory cytokines better than each supplement alone in one study (83), other data suggest benefits with folic acid on cognitive function occurs in those with a lower, rather than higher, omega-3 fatty acid status (84).",
                    "Earlier studies have shown that folic acid decreased homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality (13) (14) (15), along with lowering blood pressure in smokers (5) (16). A combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements also decreased homocysteine levels and improved anemia in patients with multiple sclerosis (74), but evidence is limited evidence on whether supplementation has an effect on anemia in patients with sickle cell disease (68). Among hypertensive adults, folic acid therapy reduced risk of first stroke (44) (45) (66), but smoking status may affect efficacy (67). Other trials on stroke risk have yielded mixed results (17) (18) (19) (20), and a meta-analysis determined the level of evidence for preventive benefits in cardiovascular disease and stroke is moderate to low (73).",

                    "Studies on increased folate intake or supplements to reduce cancer risk are mixed. Deficiency has been linked to development of esophageal squamous cell cancer (78) and low levels of folate in the blood with certain forms of cancer (9), whereas higher levels of dietary folate may reduce the risk of breast (2) and pancreatic cancers (3), but not prostate cancer (7). Folate supplementation may help cervical intraepithelial neoplasia regression (47), but studies on colorectal cancer risk produced mixed results (4) (5) (32) (35) (48) and some even suggest a negative effect (6) (8) (49) (71). A large population study suggested an association between dietary folate intake and increased risk for overall skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, particularly in women (50). Over-consumption of folic acid supplements may also increase risk of toxicity and some cancers (51) (52).

Drugs that inhibit this enzyme can therefore reduce folic acid activity. The amino acid serine reacts with tetrahydrofolate, resulting in 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate, the derivative involved in nucleotide synthesis. In addition, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transfers a methyl group to cobalamin (vitamin B12) and then to homocysteine, converting it to methionine, the precursor of methyl donor, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM-e) that plays a major role in neurological function and several biochemical pathways (41). Genetic polymorphisms that lower the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can also reduce SAM-e and increase homocysteine levels. Supplementation with folic acid can therefore reduce homocysteine levels and DNA oxidative damage (57) (58). This may in turn lower risk of cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases by increasing SAM-e (59) (60). Folic acid supplementation also improves endothelial function (16) (31); and has a protective effect on retinal vascular endothelial cells from high glucose-induced injury via regulating proteins in the Hippo signaling pathway (76).",

In animal models, fucoidan protected against liver injury via suppression of the inflammatory signaling pathway, inflammatory mediators, and inflammatory cell infiltration (20). It also reduced production of cyclooygenase-2 and NO, while increasing expression of the hepatoprotective enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 on murine liver and HepG2 cells (21). Fucoidan suppressed inflammation in an ultraviolet B-irradiated mouse model, decreasing thickness of the prickle cell layer and MMP-1 (19).",

Various antitumor, antiviral and immune-modulating effects are attributed to NK cell stimulation, and downregulation of transcription factor AP-I and IGF-IR signaling (2) (3) (32). In melanoma cells, it increased lapatinib effects via ERBB3 inhibition (33). In human colorectal cells, it reduced tumor-promoting M2 macrophages and in combination with etoposide, prevented HCT116 tumorigenicity (34). Neuroprotective effects are attributed to suppression of TNF-alpha- and IFN\u03b3-induced NO production in C6 glioma cells (11) and to antioxidative effects (12). Fucoidan inhibits metastasis by preventing adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix (4). It induced apoptosis of human T-cell leukemia virus type I that causes adult T-cell leukemia by inactivating NF-kB, which regulates antiapoptotic proteins (3). In a murine model, fucoidan suppressed angiogenesis induced by sarcoma 180 cells (5)."

When directly applied to several types of cancer cells (including estrogen receptor (ER+) and (ER-) breast cancer, prostate cancer, neuroblastoma and sarcoma), genistein inhibits their growth and replication. Genistein also competes with the body\u2019s own estrogen and inhibits the ability of a growth factor called EGF to stimulate its receptor and cause downstream cellular effects. Estrogen and EGF can enhance the growth of certain tumors (such as ER+ breast cancer), so it is thought that genistein may act against them to slow tumor growth.",

His therapy is based on the theory that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by toxic environmental substances and food processing, which changes the sodium and potassium content of foods. Gerson\u2019s rationale is that cancer patients have low immunity and generalized tissue damage characterized by decreased intracellular potassium to sodium (K/Na) ratios, and, when their cancer is destroyed, toxic degradation products cause coma and death. His diet increases potassium intake and minimizes sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver, while coffee enemas reportedly cause dilation of bile ducts and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Supplemental potassium and oxidizing thyroid enzymes are given to introduce oxidation to cancer cells and kill them. None of these claims has been substantiated by scientific research (4) (6).\n\nThis regimen has resulted in coma-inducing low levels of sodium. Case reports of deaths from repeated administration of coffee enemas indicate that the practice causes a dangerous decrease in serum electrolytes. Coffee enemas have an osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg; repeated administration increases extravascular fluid volume and may cause electrolyte imbalances and subsequent death (5).\n\nThe ease of absorption of the high volumes of raw fruit and vegetables in this diet is questionable, especially in patients with GI cancers or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage. While elements of the Gerson diet are similar to diet recommendations made by the USDA and the American Cancer Society, metabolic diets are unsuitable for some patients with disseminated or metastatic disease, particularly of the head, neck, and gut (1)."

                    "Glutamine is an amino acid that can be absorbed from food and synthesized and stored, mainly in the muscles and lungs. It is the building block of protein and a major cellular fuel source. Although abundant in the body, patients with cancer and AIDS-related cachexia or those recovering from catabolic states such as surgery, sepsis, and intense exercise may need to increase intake. Parenteral supplementation is used in hospitals, but oral formulations are available as medical food products. Glutamine is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance muscle building, wound healing, and for intestinal and immune system health.",
                    "Despite its popularity, evidence is lacking to support the use of glutamine supplements for increasing muscle mass and strength (42).",
                    "In post-surgical or critically ill patients, glutamine may improve nitrogen balance, preserve intestinal integrity, maintain intracellular glutamine levels, and reduce hospital stay (3) (4) (12) (13) (40), but data on whether it can prevent infections are mixed (5) (40). In patients with irritable bowel syndrome, glutamine supplements reduced related symptoms (36). Among patients with sickle cell anemia, treatment with glutamine resulted in significantly fewer pain crises (35).",
                    "In oncology settings, studies suggest glutamine is useful against cachexia (11), peripheral neuropathy (14) (15), mucositis (16) (17) (18) (19) (46), and fluorouracil-induced GI toxicity (20). Intravenous glutamine also reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients with gastric or colorectal cancer (21), and enteral nutrition that includes arginine , glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids may improve short-term survival in stage IV gastric cancer patients (22). Preliminary data on a supplement containing HMB, L-arginine and glutamine suggest it may help prevent sorafenib-associated hand-foot skin reactions in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (39).",
                    "Other studies suggest glutamine may reduce radiation morbidity in breast cancer patients (23) and treatment-induced mucositis and dysphagia in patients with oropharynx and larynx carcinoma (37), and delay esophagitis onset in non-small cell lung cancer patients (38). However, meta-analyses report lack of strong evidence with glutamine for oral mucositis (43) or for radiation-associated gastrointestinal toxicity (47), a systematic review cited the need for well-designed trials (44), and conflicting data indicate no impact on postsurgical complications or infections in gastrointestinal cancer patients (25). Furthermore, findings suggest a role for glutamine in tumor cell growth and maintenance (26) (27). More research is needed to resolve these ambiguities."

                    "Glutamine is essential for the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity and function (1). It maintains immune function by serving as the principle metabolic fuel for cells, acts as a precursor for protein synthesis, and along with cysteine and glycine, is involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Intravenous glutamine preserves liver and intestinal glutathione stores in animal models of oxidant damage. Glutamine is also involved in nitrogen exchange, as it neutralizes and eliminates excess ammonia formed during protein catabolism. As a nitrogen donor, it contributes to the synthesis of other non-essential amino acids, including the purines and pyrimidines, and is therefore essential for the proliferation of most cells (29). It also plays a supportive role during biochemical stress and sepsis. Reduced oxidative stress and sickle cell-related pain with l-glutamine is attributed to increased proportions of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides in sickle cell erythrocytes (35).",
                    "Although the mechanism underlying benefits against cachexia is unclear, it is thought that glutamine, a modulator of protein turnover, enhances net protein synthesis (11). Clinical evidence suggests that total parenteral nutrition supplemented with glutamine improves nitrogen balance, maintains the intracellular glutamine pool, enhances protein synthesis, and prevents deterioration of gut permeability in post-surgery patients (12).",
                    "Glutamine prevented genotoxic and clastogenic damages caused by cisplatin in mice (30). It may also potentiate the tumoricidal effect of methotrexate (MTX) since polyglutamation of MTX impairs its efflux from tumor cells and reduces its accumulation in the gut (31). The supplemental intravenous form leads to increases of GSH in the gut, but not in tumors, in a sarcoma-bearing rat model.",
                    "However, other findings show that glutamine transporters are upregulated in tumor cells and that glutamine acts as a mitochondrial substrate and promotes protein translation. This indicates tumor cell dependence for growth and maintenance (26). In addition, glutamine helps cancer cells survive acidic stress through enzymatic deamidation rather than provide nutrition (27)."

Green tea consumption may reduce the risk of dementia (90), hypertension (9) and cardiovascular disease (14), and a theaflavin-enriched extract was shown to decrease the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (8).

Data on whether green tea can reduce the risk of gastric and esophageal cancers are mixed (5) (6) (42); and there was no association between green tea and the risk of developing ovarian cancer  (93), malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma (65), although data indicate that tea intake may reduce the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (56).

Therefore, decaffeinated products may be preferred due to lower incidence of adverse events, although data are inconsistent regarding the relative efficacy of caffeinated versus decaffeinated teas. Animal studies indicate that oral consumption of green tea extract during fasting can increase the risk of toxicity (49). In humans, EGCG intake (200 mg, twice daily for one year) was shown to be safe (70) based on clinical data, whereas a daily dose amounting to 800 mg EGCG was associated with elevated liver enzymes, which was reversible with cessation of consumption (67).

Homeopathic remedies are highly diluted forms of botanical, animal, or mineral substances which when given in full strength to a healthy volunteer, cause the presenting symptoms of the patient. Opponents argue that the benefits experienced by patients are merely placebo effects (1), which are no larger than those observed in conventional medicine (2).",

Observational studies suggest that certain homeopathic products can provide long-term relief from symptoms such as headache and allergic rhinitis in adults, and atopic dermatitis and recurrent infections in children (3). One study suggests benefit with an add-on homeopathic preparation for recurrent tonsillitis (23). However, adjuvant homeopathy was not helpful for otitis media with effusion (24), and systematic reviews found data on homeopathy for otitis media or chronic rhinosinusitis to be scant and of limited quality (25) (26).

An epidemiological study found only marginal improvement for anxiety and depression among those who consulted practitioners prescribing homeopathy versus conventional care (29), and another study on homeopathy for depression was terminated early due to recruitment difficulties (28). In addition, meta-analyses have determined that evidence on homeopathy for ADHD symptoms or psychiatric disorders is lacking (30) (44), and The European Sleep Research Society does not recommend homeopathy for insomnia (31).",

I3C counteracted HPV16 immune evasion by antagonizing E6 repression of E-cadherin (64). It decreased proinflammatory cytokine production and T-cell activation by acting as histone deacetylase class I inhibitors (31). Hepatoprotective mechanisms include immunomodulation and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (66), decreased miR-31 expression, and subsequent T-cell apoptosis (32).",
                    "In cancer cells, I3C at higher doses induced apoptosis, while lower doses inhibited cell growth and cyclin E and CDK2 expression (27). Antiproliferative effects may occur by regulating microRNAs that regulate gene expression (65) and upregulation of apoptotic enzymes (48). Other observed activities include estrogen receptor modulation (15) (34) and reductions in MMP-2/9 and aromatase expression (16) (36) (37). In lung carcinoma cells, I3C induced G0/G1 apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (12). In gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, chemosensitizing occurred via downregulated microRNA-21 (43), lower LD50 of gemcitabine, and reactivation of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor gene (19). In melanoma cells, G1 apoptosis/arrest occurred via stabilization of wild-type PTEN expression (39). In prostate cancer cells, I3C inhibits Akt activation, androgen-dependent pathways, and inflammation (8) (38). In murine models, it reduced proinflammatory and procarcinogenic proteins (44).",

This therapy was developed in Mexico by Dr. Donato Perez Garcia in the 1930s and has been used together with other unconventional therapies (1). Advocates of IPT believe that cancer cells consume more sugar than healthy cells and are therefore more sensitive to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) (2) (7). Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, increasing the intracellular concentration and cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs (1). According to the theory underlying this therapy, if cancer cells can be activated by exogenous insulin, a reduced dose (up to one-tenth the normal dose) of a chemotherapy drug can provide the same cytotoxic effects with less severe adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic profiles on concurrent use of insulin and chemotherapy drugs are lacking and it is unclear whether insulin also potentiates toxic effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells. Exploratory studies suggest some benefit with a combination of chemotherapy and IPT (9) (10), but well-designed clinical trials have not been conducted.",

Neuroprotective effects are also thought to be due to its selective binding to glutamate receptors (2).",

L-theanine also stabilizes glutamatergic concentrations in the brain, which may explain its therapeutic effect in patients with schizophrenia (21).",
                    "L-theanine was shown to increase the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and idarubicin (5) (6). These agents normally bind the glutamate receptor and the complex is transported across the cell resulting in reduced concentrations, hence attenuating effects of these drugs. Consequent mechanistic studies revealed that L-theanine, a glutamate analogue, competes with glutamate to bind the glutamate receptor, resulting in suppression of chemotherapy efflux (extracellular transport), increasing their concentration (27).",

The proposed mechanism is based on the variance of glutamate receptors expressed in normal and tumor cells. Whereas theanine binds the glutamate receptor in tumor cells, it is metabolized to glutamate in normal cells. This increase in glutamate likely results in increased efflux of doxorubicin from the cells, thereby decreasing toxicity (28).",

In mice with anosmia, anxiolytic effects with lavender inhalation were likely due to serotonergic mechanisms rather than olfactory activation (30) (31). However, whether lavender alleviates or exacerbates anxiety may actually be determined by genetic influences on temperament as these behaviors were amplified after exposure to lavender inhalation in calm versus nervous sheep (56). Antiepileptic effects are due to suppressed nitric oxide levels in the brain (26). Cardioprotective effects are attributed to lavender\u2019s antioxidant properties (35).

Lemongrass inhibits release of the inflammation marker myeloperoxidase from neutrophils and suppresses IL-6 and IL-1alpha production in mice peritoneal macrophages (13). A lemongrass hexane extract modulated allergic asthma via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation (34). Analgesic effects by the constituent citronellol are attributed to inhibition of peripheral mediators as well as central inhibitory mechanisms (22).

Cytotoxicity was attributed to the presence of an unsaturated aldehyde group, which is specific to the geranial isomer of citral (9). Polysaccharides from lemongrass produced cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in cervical and prostate carcinoma cells via caspase 3 upregulation and Bcl-2 downregulation followed by cytochrome c release (29), and antitumor and immunomodulatory activities in sarcoma-180 tumor cells were attributed to immunoenhancement rather than direct cytotoxicity (31)."

                    "Derived from the root of the plant, licorice is used to flavor foods. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine to detoxify and enhance or balance the effects of other components in herbal formulations. In Ayurveda, licorice is used as a tonic, an expectorant, and as a demulcent. A number of compounds including glycyrrhizin are thought to be responsible for its biological effects. Licorice supplements are promoted for menopausal symptoms, digestive issues, cough, and bacterial and viral infections. Preclinical findings indicate antibacterial (2) (27), antiviral (48), anticancer (3) (4) (28) (29), anti-inflammatory (30), and hepatoprotective (49) effects. Licorice also demonstrated estrogenic effects (10), reduced cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin (31), and improved the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide (32).\n\nClinical data suggest benefits of this herb in lowering dyspepsia (1) and hyperlipidemia (33). Concurrent intake of a glycyrrhizin-containing product during alcohol consumption was found to have hepatoprotective effects (50). When combined with fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei, licorice reduced bacterial density and improved histologic inflammation in patients with H. pylori infection (62); and preoperative gargling with a licorice solution reduced postoperative sore throat compared to gargling with sugar water (51). Systematic reviews have confirmed benefits of topical licorice in preventing postoperative sore throat (63) (73).",

A systematic review and meta analysis found herbal formulas containing licorice to alleviate chemo-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with colorectal cancer (75).",

In another study, LBP antioxidant effects against insulin resistance were attributed to PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 pathway activation (24). It also exerted protective effects against focal cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (25). In murine models of acute pancreatitis, LBP reduced inflammation by upregulating NRF2 and HO-1 (30). Protective effects against diabetic peripheral neuropathy is thought to be mediated via autophagy induction (31).\n\nLBP inhibited the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells (2) and increased expression of IL-2 and TNF-alpha (3). Antiproliferative effects may occur via activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (20). In H22 tumor-bearing mice, LBP alleviated immunosuppression and maintained antitumor immune responses (32).",

Compared to the senna and placebo groups, the MZRW arm also had a significant increase in colonic transit along with decreased severity in straining, constipation, incomplete evacuation, and global constipation symptoms. Benefits were also more durable in the MZRW group (5). Similar improvements have been reported in other randomized double-blind studies. Patients with functional constipation who took MZRW had increased CSBM and reductions in constipation severity and use of rescue therapy compared to the placebo group (6). In a pilot RCT for palliative cancer patients with constipation, modified MZRW was well-tolerated, increased in stool frequency, and reduced constipation severity and straining versus placebo (16).",

Increased LH and decreased FSH that corresponded with improved sexual functioning in postmenopausal women are potentially attributed to a negative feedback loop, resulting in increased androgen production (24) (26).

Some studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure following supplementation (24) (25) (80), and a meta-analysis also suggests antihypertensive effects (26). However, data from a large community-based cohort did not show low serum levels to be a risk factor for developing hypertension or cardiovascular disease (27).

It negatively regulates vascular calcification and osteogenic differentiation through an increase or restoration of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) activity and increased expression of anticalcification proteins, in vitro (45). It also influences blood pressure levels through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system, by acting as a calcium channel blocker to reduce vascular resistance, and by modulating vascular tone and reactivity (46) (47). Further, it contributes to the homeostasis of electrolytes in cells via sodium-potassium pump activation (47) and can revert impaired intracellular ion homeostasis (25).",
                    "As a cofactor of all reactions involving ATP transfer, magnesium is a major determinant of insulin and glucose metabolism, critical to carbohydrate metabolism, and regulates the activity of all enzymes involved in phosphorylation reactions (48). These vascular and metabolic mechanisms are echoed by observed relationships between deficiency and oxidative stress, proinflammatory states, endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia (48) (49). A possible mechanism of cardiovascular benefits may be via a reduction in arterial stiffness (76).",
                    "Magnesium can also serve an immunomodulatory function by regulating NF-kB activation and cytokine production, and limiting systemic inflammation (50). It also reduces markers for systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein (4) (51). Its salts are poorly absorbed, and act as an osmotic laxative by retaining water in the intestine. The mechanism by which it may affect the bioavailability of concomitantly administered drugs is through the formation of insoluble chelate complexes with those drugs, substantially reducing their bioavailability (52).",
                    "Experimental and epidemiological evidence for the role of magnesium in cancer is conflicting. Its part in cellular metabolism and maintaining genetic stability, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection against insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation are also cancer-preventive attributes (18) (19). At the same time, hypomagnesemia as a side effect of some cancer treatments may produce an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and neo-angiogenesis, but magnesium levels are also increased in tumors both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its multiple and possibly dichotomous roles in cancer (53) (54)."

It is purported that the positive (south) pole of the magnet has a \u201cstress effect,\u201d which interferes with metabolic functioning, produces acidity, reduces cellular oxygen supply, and encourages the replication of latent microorganisms. The negative (north) pole is said to have a \u201ccalming effect\u201d and helps to normalize metabolic functioning, promote oxygenation, and treat neurological/psychiatric disorders. No evidence supports these claims, and no anticancer activity is seen with magnetic fields in laboratory or human studies. Most anecdotes of magnetic \u201chealing\u201d involve symptoms that may be psychosomatic, associated with stress, or subjective measures such as pain or depression (3).\n\nTheoretically, static magnetic fields (SMFs) may alter ion flow, cellular potential, membrane configuration, ion pump activity, or neurotransmitter release (4). Most of the biological phenomena associated with SMFs may be caused by changes in cellular calcium (8). SMFs of 1,000-4,000 G are found to alter protein and enzyme structure and the kinetics of reactions involving free radicals (7) (9). Reduced action potential firing in cultured neurons and permeability changes in synthetic liposome vesicles are observed after application of a SMF (5). It may not be legitimate to extrapolate in vitro data in which cells are directly exposed to magnetic fields, to their effect in a complex biological system. Moreover, many in vitro studies have not been replicated. Although some authors refer to documented effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields in attempting to explain a mechanism of action for static magnets, SMFs do not generate an electric field and therefore cannot confer the claimed physiologic effects (10).

They have also been evaluated for their anticancer potential. Magnolol demonstrated activity against a variety of cancers, including bladder (10) (11) (12), prostate (13) (14) (15) (16), colorectal (17) (18), breast (19) (20), and lung (21) (22) cancers . Honokiol also showed antitumor and antiangiogenic effects (23) (24) (25) in leukemia (26), lung (27) (28), bladder (29), prostate (30), melanoma (31) (32), breast (33), glioblastoma (34), neuroblastoma (35), and oral cancer (36) cells lines.

Antihyperglycemic effects with magnolia bark extract are attributed to the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase enzyme 1B, a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, which increases ERK phosphorylation and GLUt4 translocation (5). Magnolol increased both insulin-stimulated glucose transport and production of GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA, and GLUT4 protein (6).",

In human bladder cancer cells, it induced p27KIP1-mediated G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (11), and decreased binding of transcription factor NF-kB to DNA to inhibit MMP9 expression (12). In prostate cancer cells, magnolol affected insulin-like growth factor-1 expression and associated binding proteins (13), inhibited the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (16), and downregulated MMP2 and MMP9 proteins and mRNA levels (15).

It also blocked VEGF-induced Rac to prevent migration of malignant endothelial cells (25), blocked signaling pathways in tumor cells with defective p53 (23), and suppressed NF-kB overactivity (24). In acute myeloid leukemia cells, honokiol inhibited STAT3 signaling via increased protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 expression (26). In glioma cells, it induced autophagy and activated a p53/cyclin D1/CDK6/CDK4/E2F1-dependent pathway to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (34) and in prostate cancer cells, honokiol suppressed c-Myc protein expression (30).",

                    "A type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) derived mainly from fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids are used as dietary supplements for depression, to lower cholesterol, and to reduce the risk of heart attack. A large survey of Finnish adults found that depressive symptoms were significantly higher among infrequent fish consumers (1) and in other studies individuals with major depression had marked depletions in omega-3 (2). Supplementation, however, did not prevent depression (77), relieve depression in adults with major depression (3), including those with or at risk of coronary heart disease (65), with mild to moderate depression (4), with perinatal depression (5); or in obese or overweight adults with subsyndromal depressive symptoms (66), and yielded mixed results in those with schizophrenia (23). But data from a randomized trial suggest that omega-3 may be useful in reducing the risk of progression to psychiatric disorders and as a safe preventive measure in young adults at risk for psychotic conditions (35).",
                    "Supplementation in pregnant women did not lower the incidence of early preterm delivery, nor the higher incidence of interventions in post-term deliveries (67), and did not improve cognitive or language outcomes in early childhood  (37), or intelligence (42). But DHA was shown to improve learning and memory function in age-related cognitive decline (41) although a large, long-term study of omega-3 with or without multidomain lifestyle interventions of physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice failed to find significant effects on cognitive decline in elderly adults with memory complaints (52).\nSupplementation also did not have a significant effect on incidence or progression of age-related macular degeneration (73).\n\nOmega-3 lowers cholesterol (8) (33) and may reduce recurrence in patients with a history of stroke (32). In individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, supplementation improved cardiometabolic profiles (53), but did not prevent incident atrial fibrillation (78) nor lower the risk of cardiovascular disease events (9) (72) although a meta analysis reported that the protective effects of EPA and DHA increase with dosage (79). Omega-3 may also help patients with ulcerative colitis (10), but was ineffective in the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease (13). In adults with rheumatoid arthritis, supplementation led to reductions in NSAID use (14); it may also be effective in reducing NSAID-associated gastro-duodenal damage (47). Other studies indicate that omega-3 may lower the magnitude of the body\u2019s inflammatory response (18), and can reduce sensitivity to sunburn (20) and to ultraviolet radiation (44). Reviews of omega-3 trials have shown possible benefits for patients with cystic fibrosis (21), but no benefit in those with asthma (22). Supplementation with fish oil may help reduce the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (24). Another large trial also reported benefit of omega-3 supplementation, with or without Vitamin D, in reducing the risk of autoimmune disease although the reductions were statistically insignificant (80).\n\nIn type 1 diabetic patients, long-term omega-3 supplementation had positive effects on neuropathy, measured by increases in corneal nerve fiber length (54). But among patients with dry eye disease, supplementation did not have a significant benefit (60). Findings of a systematic review support benefits of omega-3 on insulin sensitivity and adipocyte function (45). However, high-dose supplementation did not improve features associated with metabolic syndrome such as adipose tissue lipolysis or inflammation in insulin-resistant adults (55). In another trial, DHA was found more effective compared to eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) in modulating indicators of inflammation and blood lipids (50). In women with gestational diabetes, supplementation with omega-3 and vitamin E improved some markers of inflammation and oxidative stress as well as incidence of newborn hyperbilirubinemia (56). In hemodialysis patients, omega-3 significantly reduced serum creatinine (57), but did not reduce arteriovenous fistula failure (58).\n\nData on omega-3 for cancer prevention are inconclusive. It may reduce colon cancer risk (11); improve immune response in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection (12); and reduce the incidence and severity of oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity (74) but did not affect cancer outcomes (15) (43). Also, perioperative use of intravenous omega-3 resulted in infectious complications in patients undergoing elective colon resection for non-metastasized cancer (68). Conflicting data suggest beneficial association between higher omega-3 intake and improved survival among stage III colon cancer patients with wild-type KRAS and deficient MMR (69); supplementation was also associated with reduced occurrence of renal cell carcinoma in women (16). Furthermore, fish oil supplementation may lower the risk of breast cancer (36); improve overall survival (70) and xerostomia, but not toxicity (71) associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. According to data from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), high blood concentrations of omega-3 were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (17). In patients with sporadic colorectal neoplasia, EPA supplementation did not affect reductions in the proportion of patients with at least one colorectal adenoma when compared to aspirin or placebo (61). Also, in the prevention trial VITAL, supplementation did not lower incidence of invasive cancer or major cardiovascular events compared to placebo (62) although updated analyses show significant reduction in cancer mortality (75).",
                    "Preliminary findings suggest that fish oil supplementation increases efficacy of chemotherapy, improves survival (38), and helps maintain weight and muscle mass (39) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and improves quality of life scores in gastrointestinal cancer patients  (81). But conflicting data suggest otherwise (59) (82) although a positive correlation was reported between adherence to supplementation and the ability to reduce weight loss during radiotherapy (83). Additional studies found an EPA-enriched oral supplement improved tolerability of chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer patients (40); and when combined with chemotherapy, fish oil supplements may delay tumor progression in those with colorectal cancer (49). Omega-3 supplements may also have a protective effect on the olfactory system in patients following endoscopic resection of sellar and parasellar masses (76)."

Changes in omega-3 fatty acid blood levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease and depression (27). The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids likely are due its ability to be incorporated into and thereby enhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques (26). Increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to increase lipid peroxidation. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, therefore, may increase oxidative stress on the body. Studies have shown that mucosal alpha-tocopherol levels decrease upon omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, which researchers believe may result from the body\u2019s attempt to counteract the added oxidative burden (11). Besides reducing serum antioxidant levels, little is known about how this added oxidative stress affects the body.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to decrease IL-6 (18) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (28) levels while leaving most other mononuclear cell functions unaffected (29). Omega-3 fatty acids may also reduce inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis by reducing rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 (10). Because of their anti-inflammatory effects, omega-3 fatty acids were thought to benefit patients with asthma (22) and cystic fibrosis (21), but data are inconclusive.",

                    "The term \u201cProbiotic\u201d (Greek for \u201cprolife\u201d) came into being in the 1960s to define substances produced by protozoa, which support the growth of other microorganisms (1). Following revisions over the years, probiotics are currently defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization as \u201clive microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host\u201d (2). Most probiotics consist of lactic-acid producing, non-virulent bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium and Enterococcus or non-pathogenic yeasts such as Saccharomyces boulardii. Probiotics have gained immense popularity over the last two decades for their perceived health benefits which include improved digestion, immune function and nutrient absorption but the most important being the reversal of dysbiosis (changes in the function or composition of gut microbes or \u201cmicrobiota\u201d) that is hypothesized to play a role in the development of several chronic and degenerative diseases (3). Although gut microbiota is known to develop at birth, nutrition, lifestyle, and changes in the host genome during later years can shift its makeup and activity, which in turn influences overall health and the risk of developing disease. Antibiotic use has also been associated with gut microbiota disruption in general population, increasing the risk of chronic disease (77); in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (4), with the greatest shifts occuring between stem cell infusion and reconstitution of healthy immune cells (75); as well as in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation patients (5). Furthermore, antibiotics were found to inhibit the benefits of immune checkpoint-inhibitors in patients with advanced cancer (78); and patients who were administered antibiotics before, and not during, immune checkpoint-inhibitor therapy had worse treatment response and overall survival  (79). Research is underway to determine strategies for modulating the gut microbiome to improve immune response in cancer.",
                    "Probiotic supplementation is currently promoted for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, dental cavities, and for the management of diarrhea induced by antibiotics, by the bacterium Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), and that associated with chemotherapy (64). However, authoritative guidelines for probiotic use have not yet been established nor is there a consensus about the minimum number of microorganisms needed to derive benefits.",
                    "Probiotics have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials and the strongest evidence of their effectiveness is for acute infectious diarrhea, the main cause of acute gastroenteritis (7). Probiotic supplementation also was shown useful in alleviating antibiotic-associated diarrhea (8). Although randomized trials did not find any benefit for managing C. difficile-associated diarrhea (9), a meta analysis suggests moderate quality evidence to support use of probiotics for preventing C. difficile infection (63). The role of probiotics in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been the focus of many studies and available data support their efficacy for pouchitis (inflammation of the ileal pouch in post-colectomy patients). Interestingly, even though a range of products were shown useful in treating and sustaining remissions of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis, findings of Crohn\u2019s disease are not promising (65). Based on the association of intestinal bacteria with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), probiotic supplementation has been explored in a few studies. Although current data are encouraging, well-designed trials to support use are lacking (11). In a study of patients with systemic sclerosis, probiotics did not improve gastrointestinal symptoms (67).\nIn addition, analyses of the National Health and Nutrition survey results revealed that consumption of yogurt or probiotics reduces the risk of proteinuric kidney disease (12), but definitive conclusions about the role of probiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections (13) or bacterial vaginosis (60) are lacking. Probiotic use was also shown to increase resistance to risk factors associated with dental caries in a randomized trial (14), and to improve memory impairment in a murine model (15). The utility of probiotics in preventing allergies has been addressed as well, with studies showing a moderate benefit for eczema prevention but not for other allergic conditions (16). Probiotic supplementation was also shown useful for the reduction of glycemic and inflammatory markers in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (58). But evidence to support its role in managing cystic fibrosis is lacking (61). In other studies, supplementation did not have a preventive effect against influenza in women healthcare workers (82), nor against bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women (83).",
                    "As increasing evidence indicates that gut bacteria are important determinants of metabolic disorders, probiotics are being investigated as a possible therapeutic option. Thus far, beneficial effects have been reported against obesity and diabetes in mice and in humans (17). Meta analyses suggest that probiotic supplementation helps reduce periodontal parameters and halitosis associated with severe periodontitis (68), helps prevent oral candidiasis in the elderly (62), may lower fasting blood glucose level in adults (59) and may also improve lipid metabolism by lowering the levels of LDL and total cholesterol (18).",
                    "Another important application of probiotic therapy is in pediatrics for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and allergies. Meta analyses indicate that enteral supplementation of probiotics is effective in preventing severe necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants (19). And a significant reduction in acute diarrhea was reported in children, independent of the bacterial strains employed (7) (69).  Studies also indicate efficacy of probiotics against antibiotic-associated diarrhea (20) and for lowering the incidence of eczema in late infancy (70). But available evidence does not support use for allergic diseases (21), and data are insufficient to assess effects in children with short bowel syndrome, a malabsorption disorder (22).",
                    "Preliminary studies indicate that probiotics may also have anti-carcinogenic potential. Oral administration of Lactobacillus casei BL23 had a protective effect against dimethyl hydrazine-induced colorectal cancer (23), and a probiotic mixture attenuated the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (24). A study done in a murine model of melanoma suggests that manipulating the microbiota may modulate cancer immunotherapy, by enhancing antitumor immunity in vivo through administering a Bifidobacterium strain (71). Gut microbiome may also modulate responses to anti PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients (80). In addition, a large epidemiological study reported an association between consumption of non-pasteurized dairy products and lower incidence of colorectal cancer (25). Probiotics may also aid in controlling symptoms associated with cancer treatments: Systematic reviews found probiotic supplementation to affect reductions in the severity and frequency of treatment-associated diarrhea, and the need for anti-diarrheal medication in cancer patients (26); and to promote recovery of gastrointestinal function following gastrointestinal cancer surgery  (89).  In colorectal cancer patients, perioperative probiotic treatment reduced surgical site infections (27), improved bowel function (28), and a systematic review concluded that probiotics/synbiotics help modulate enteric microbiota, improve postoperative outcomes, gut barrier function and reduce inflammatory parameters (86). Probiotics may also help prevent chemo-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients  (90); decrease the severity of chemo- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (87); and reduce oral Candida following radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer  (88), although supplementation was ineffective in preventing radiation-induced mucositis (72). Despite these promising findings, a systematic review evaluating safety and efficacy of probiotics in oncological surgery found substantial risk of bias across majority of the studies analyzed, warranting the need for well-designed studies  (91).",
                    "In addition to probiotics, other strategies used to modulate gut microbiota that have gained attention include \u201cprebiotics\u201d and \u201cfecal microbiota transplantation\u201d (FMT). Prebiotics, also known as functional foods, are non-digestible food ingredients that benefit the host by selectively promoting growth or activity of helpful gut bacteria. Currently used prebiotics include the fructans inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and lactulose. A few studies have evaluated the utility of prebiotics for IBS but data are conflicting (11). Because probiotics are short-lived, prebiotics are being co-administered to maintain their levels in the gut. This combination of pro- and prebiotics is called \u201csynbiotic therapy\u201d and has been shown useful in controlling symptoms associated with IBS (30); and may also benefit gut functioning in healthy community-dwelling elders (84).\nFMT involves administration of fecal matter from a healthy donor into a recipient by enema, colonoscopy or through the upper gastrointestinal tract in the form of oral capsules, via nasogastric, nasoduodenal or nasoenteric tube, or by endoscopy, to restore normal gut flora. Some studies indicate that FMT might benefit IBS patients although the quality of evidence is low (31). In oncology settings, FMT has been reported effective for treating immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated colitis (81); and autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (auto-FMT), for reestablishing intestinal microbiota composition in patients with gut microbiota depletion due to antibiotic treatment during allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (76).",
                    "Although an increasing number of studies suggest that probiotics may improve certain health outcomes by inducing favorable changes in the intestinal bacteria, the overall evidence to support their use is limited due to small sample size, poor methodology, variation in the species and strains of bacteria, and in the dosage and duration of administration. Variation in the response to probiotics is also an important factor to consider because genes that respond to probiotic intake were shown to be strain-specific (32) and to cluster according to the individual and not by intervention (32) (33). Furthermore, gut colonization is not always achieved despite supplementation with probiotics (73). In another study that examined post-antibiotic recovery in humans, administration of probiotics was associated with a delay in gut-microbiome reconstitution (74). Well-designed studies and specific recommendations are needed to establish probiotic use for different age groups and disorders, and to determine long-term safety.",
                    "Of note, early observational data suggest that indiscriminate use of commercially available probiotics may be harmful in the setting of immune checkpoint blockade treatment in cancer patients (92)."

Probiotics can also indirectly influence shifts in microbiota by interacting with the mucosal system, which affects systemic immunity; and by reducing pro-inflammatory markers implicated in many disorders (34) (35).",
                    "Studies using murine models indicate that administration of S. boulardii to type-2 diabetic and obese mice resulted in reduced inflammation, body weight, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis, along with decreased bacterial population that has been previously associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes (36). Probiotic treatment also affected a reduction in food intake and an improvement in glucose tolerance via release of the hormone glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1), a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake (37).",
                    "Immunomodulation is one of the ways in which probiotics are thought to influence host health. A subspecies of Bifidobacterium longum prevented Salmonella-associated infection in mice by inducing T-regulatory cells and by attenuating the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, which plays a role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (38). Induction of T-regulatory cells was also shown in humans along with a reduction in pro-inflammatory biomarkers (39). In addition probiotic administration was shown to reduce pain perception, and to induce changes in the colonic expression of genes that mediate pain and inflammation (40). And a probiotic mixture reduced the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by shifting the gut microbes toward beneficial bacteria, which produce anti-inflammatory metabolites (24). Protective effects of probiotics were also reported in a murine model of mammary carcinogenesis. Oral administration of a supplement containing Lactobacillus reuteri resulted in inhibition of mammary tumor formation by triggering CD4+/CD25+ lymphocytes, which play a critical role in controlling immune responses (41). Because intestinal bacteria have been shown to influence carcinogenesis and response to anticancer therapy, manipulating them selectively may be a potential strategy to enhance the efficacy of anticancer treatments (66)."

Artepillin C also sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by engaging both extrinsic receptor-mediated and intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (21).

Resveratrol acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity (26). It has been shown to decrease C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor, and increase anti-inflammatory IL-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in humans (5). Decreases in oxidative stress and improved insulin sensitivity may occur via increased protein kinase activities (10). Resveratrol also decreased circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 and IGF-binding protein-3 levels (27) which may account for its antidiabetic effects observed in some studies. Preliminary data suggest that it increases the life span of yeast cells by activating sirtuins (1) (2), and inhibiting human Sirt3 along with stimulating Sirt5 and Sirt1 (28). Neuroprotective effects may occur via regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the Akt/mTOR pathway (51).",

Reductions in breast cancer cell migration and invasion have been observed (30) (31), and resveratrol growth factor heregulin-beta1 mediated MMP9 expression (30). However, contradictory data show that resveratrol mimics phytoestrogens and could activate genes that are normally regulated by estrogens or androgens (18) (19). In other studies resveratrol helped reduce prostate tumorigenesis through reduced prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 activity and increased expression of SIRT1 (32). It modulates steroid hormone-dependent pathways to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth; however it also increases angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis in vivo (19).",

Protective effects of resveratrol against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity are due to upregulation of SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation (20).

They are marketed as dietary supplements to treat hot flashes, high cholesterol, and to prevent cancer. Isoflavones exhibit both selective estrogen receptor modulator activity and non-hormonal effects. Studies of soy for menopausal symptoms are inconclusive (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9). While some trials indicate slower bone density loss (10) (11) (91), others report no such effects in postmenopausal women (12) (13). But there may be cardiovascular benefits (17), as soy reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (14) (15) along with having beneficial effects on blood pressure in postmenopausal women (16) (97) and in healthy adults (90). A meta-analysis confirmed that consumption of soy leads to reductions in both total cholesterol and LDL in adults (99), and fermented soy products were inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease in women  (104).",

Soy may also reduce the risk of lung (24) (80) and endometrial (25) (26) cancers, but can increase the risk of bladder cancer (27) and endometrial hyperplasia (28).

But a large population-based study found that fermented soy foods may only decrease the risk of non-localized breast cancer, not the overall risk (108). Further, long-term supplementation did not affect mammographic density in breast cancer patients or in high-risk women (95) and other data suggest adverse effects (31) (32) or that supplementation can stimulate over-expression of breast cancer genes in patients with invasive breast cancer (87). Preclinical findings indicate that soy consumption may increase metastasis (33); and daidzin-rich extracts can promote ER-positive breast cancer growth (88).",

However, animal studies show that it antagonizes the effects of tamoxifen (38) (39) and promotes tumor progression in advanced prostate cancer (40). Supplementation may also decrease serum PSA levels in prostate cancer patients before (41); but not after prostatectomy despite long-term consumption (82) and secondary analysis of data from this study revealed that it did not affect major cardiovascular risk factors nor exert any adverse effects on thyroid function (110).",

Both isoflavones may modulate bone remodeling through ERs by regulating target gene expression (50). Soy may also contribute to maintaining bone density by causing less calcium to be excreted in the urine (35). Isoflavones may inhibit oxidation of LDL and alter hepatic metabolism with enhanced removal of LDL and VLDL by hepatocytes (17). Serum lipids may also be regulated through modified transcription factor and downstream gene expression and by promoting antioxidant enzyme activity (51).",
                    "In addition, several mechanisms have been proposed for soy\u2019s anticancer effects. Genistein affects microRNA expression-targeted translation inhibitors for multiple proteins implicated in regulating various pathobiological processes (52). It also demonstrated an anti-minichromosome maintenance (MCM) effect, a gene family frequently upregulated in various cancers and considered a promising anticancer drug target (53).",
                    "In breast cancer cells, genistein acts as an agonist to estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha in ER-alpha-predominant cells, but likely acts as an antiestrogen in cells with ER-beta alone, suggesting therapeutic potential for premenopausal women with ER-alpha-negative/ER-beta-positive tumors (54). However, genistein induces estrogen-dependent MCF-7 tumor cell growth and increases breast cancer-associated aromatase expression/activity, suggesting that soy-based supplements may affect aromatase inhibitor efficacy (55). Genistein is also known to negate tamoxifen\u2019s inhibitory effect on MCF-7 tumor growth and increase expression of estrogen-responsive genes (38). Alternatively, soy isoflavones may reduce breast cancer risk by decreasing endogenous ovarian steroid levels (56). Studies suggest that some benefits ascribed to dietary isoflavones may depend on early life exposure, thereby impacting gene expression at the epigenetic level (47) (48) (49).",
                    "In prostate tumors, soy protein was shown to reduce androgen receptor expression (57). Both genistein and daidzein affect microRNA regulation (58) and induce decreased methylation of gene promoters, including BRCA1 (59). In tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-resistant prostate cancer cells, soy isoflavones enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by engaging apoptotic pathways and regulating NF-\u03baB activity (60) (61). However, in a patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft model, increased proliferation and metastasis in genistein-treated groups were linked to enhanced activities of tyrosine kinases, the epidermal growth factor receptor, and its downstream Src (40). Both genistein and daidzein also act as radiosensitizers for prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo, but pure genistein increased lymph node metastasis, whereas the combination of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein did not. Daidzein may protect against genistein-induced metastasis, and its ability to inhibit cell growth and potentiate radiation appears to be androgen-receptor-independent (62). In addition, soy isoflavones radiosensitized human A549 NSCLC cells, and decreased hemorrhages, inflammation, and fibrosis caused by radiation suggesting protection of normal lung tissue (63)."

Only the dimeric and tetrameric forms of miraculin are active (11). In a weakly acidic environment, miraculin acts as a positive allosteric modulator; at neutral pH, it acts as an antagonist that can inhibit the activity of other sweeteners including sucrose, saccharine and aspartame (8).

In diabetic neuropathic pain models, tribulus modulates oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine release in a dose-dependent manner via increases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione and lipid peroxide levels (32). In chronic mild stress models, the attenuation of serum corticotropin-releasing factor and cortisol levels by tribulus saponins suggest normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity (31). Antihypertensive effects occur via arterial smooth muscle relaxation, NO release, and membrane hyperpolarization (3). An aqueous extract also demonstrated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition activity (2) that may help lower blood pressure. Phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid may be responsible for reputed cardioprotective properties (29).",
                    "Tribulus extracts induce apoptosis and suppress cancer cell proliferation by activating caspase 3, dephosphorylating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 (15), and by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) signaling (12). Saponins from tribulus inhibit multiple-drug resistance of cancer cells (11). In breast carcinoma cell lines, a saponin extract changed mRNA levels of CXCR4, CCR7 and BCL2 genes (38). In models of human prostate cancer, antitumor and antiangiogenic activities are attributed to cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic induction not involving the caspase pathway (39). Saponins also act as a modulator of apoptosis: in normal human keratinocytes, saponins attenuate UVB-induced programmed cell death through inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but enhance apoptotic response in squamous cell carcinomas (40). The photoprotective effect of saponins is attributed to enhanced NER gene expression and inhibition of UVB-mediated NF-kappaB activation (40). In animal models, a hydroalcoholic extract of tribulus relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity, perhaps via diuretic effects that increase drug excretion, scavenging free radicals via increase in antioxidant enzymes, suppressing inflammatory agents, and acting on organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins (41).",

Curcumin also appears to have synergistic effects with isoflavones, suppressing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production in prostate cells through anti-androgen effects (36).\n\nStudies done on breast cancer show that curcumin may inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (28). Data also suggest that curcumin induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells independent of p21 expression (39). Curcumin\u2019s antitumor actions appear to be due to its interactions with arachidonate metabolism and its in vivo antiangiogenic properties (14). Another possible chemopreventive mechanism may be via binding and activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thereby protecting the small intestine and colon where VDRs are expressed and vitamin D is known to serve an anticancer function (38). Curcumin also inhibited growth of uterine leiomyosarcoma cells by targeting the AKT-mTOR (RAC-alpha serine-threonine-protein kinase; mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (37).

VA in animals inhibits the enzyme system responsible for central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activity, and direct binding of this constituent to GABA-receptors has been demonstrated (37).

Vinpocetine helps improve spatial memory in rats by preventing neuronal damage and favorably modulating cholinergic function (18). Antiepileptic effects were attributed to suppression of abnormal neuronal excitability via sodium channel regulation and dopamine release in striatal nerve endings (5) (6) (7). Vinpocetine antagonizes platelet-derived growth factor-induced extracellular matrix synthesis, suppresses intracellular ROS production, and inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth (4). Antiatherogenic effects occur through inhibition of monocyte adhesion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses mediated by protein kinase B/nuclear factor kappa B-dependent pathways (3).

In humans, two enzymatic reactions dependent on B12 are produced and activated in separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria (1). As a coenzyme in methyl transfer reactions, B12 converts homocysteine to methionine, and participates in L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion to succinyl-CoA (8). In the first enzyme reaction, methylcobalamin is used to recycle the folate cofactor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate thereby allowing the folate cofactor to participate in a cycle involving the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. During this reaction, homocysteine is converted to methionine yielding the methyl groups required for methylation that is essential in biosynthesis (31).",

Its phosphorylated metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine to cysteine, and glycogen phosphorylase activity which mobilizes glucose from glycogen (32). It is a cofactor along with cystathionine b synthase and cystathionase to produce cysteine and glutathione from their precursor homocysteine (33). Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the major coenzyme form, the most abundant in animal tissue, and the cofactor for over 100 enzymes used in amino acid metabolism, including aminotransferases, decarboxylases, racemases, and dehydrases. It also facilitates mobilization of glucose units from glycogen via glycogen phosphorylase (32). PLP is also the active antiemetic form of B6, of which pyridoxine and pyridoxal have been identified as prodrugs (45).",
                    "In animal models, an excess-pyridoxine diet actively influenced cell-mediated immunity via enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production and Th1-polarization (34). In several cancer cell lines, B6 contributed to increased p21 gene expression via p53 activation (4). Proposed mechanisms for an inverse relationship of B6 intake and serum PLP with cancer risk include: 1) its participation in one-carbon metabolism that is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation; 2) the high uracil and chromosome breaks caused by B6 deficiency which may interfere with these processes leading to aberrant gene expression, DNA instability, and eventual disease; and 3) possible cancer-suppression effects through reductions in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nitric oxide synthesis (16) (21).",
                    "At the same time, because PLP is the metabolically active form of B6, it is thought to be responsible for instances of vitamin B6 toxicity (29). High circulating pyridoxine levels may have direct toxic effects on peripheral sensory ganglia neurons in the lower blood\u2013nerve barrier, whereas the blood\u2013brain barrier protects neurons in those regions from higher levels (35).

                    "The role of vitamin C in cancer prevention is not definitive. High plasma levels of vitamin C were associated with lower gastrointestinal cancer incidence probably due to protective effects against dietary carcinogenic nitroso compounds (19). Intake of vitamins A, C, or E reduced cervical cancer risk (20), but did not prevent gastrointestinal (21), prostate (22), lung (23) cancers or affect mortality (24) (73). Supplemental but not dietary vitamin C was associated with an increased risk of liver cancer (25).",

Preclinical studies found that cancer cells preferentially uptake vitamin C (37) and render some chemotherapy drugs less effective (38). Also, a major concern surrounding the use of antioxidants such as vitamin C is that they can interfere with the actions of chemotherapy and radiation therapy that rely on the production of reactive oxygen species for their cytotoxic activities (39). However, a clinical study showed that ascorbic acid does not reduce the therapeutic effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin (40). Another study found an increase in chemotherapy-associated adverse effects with inadequate intake of vitamin C in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (41). In other preliminary studies, short-term vitamin C plus E supplementation during radiotherapy had a protective effect against xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer (75); a combination of vitamins C, E, and selenium lowered radioiodine-induced oxidative stress in thyroid cancer patients (76); and supplementation may enhance effects of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors in patients with myeloid cancers (89). Still, older trials in advanced cancer patients using 10 g per day of oral vitamin C did not demonstrate significant benefits (29) (30). This lack of effect is explained by the finding of a pharmacokinetic study that ascorbic acid can only reach a limited plasma concentration through oral administration (31).",
                    "Intravenous high-dose vitamin C has been long been used as an alternative cancer treatment (26) based on the hypothesis that formation of new collagen resists malignant infiltration (27). In preclinical studies, higher pharmacologic concentrations could be achieved via intravenous injection and had selective cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines (32) (33), and early reports using parenteral plus oral ascorbic acid showed promising results (28). Ascorbic acid is postulated to act as a carrier of hydrogen peroxide to the extracelluar fluid (32) where it generates free radicals against tumor cells (33). High-dose IV ascorbic acid up to 1.5 g/kg/day (34), or used with chemotherapy (74) appears to be well-tolerated. It may improve the quality of life of terminal cancer patients (35), and reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicity (67). This led to a renewed interest in studying high-dose IV vitamin C as an anticancer treatment (34) (36). However, it should be regarded as an investigational drug and used only in a clinical trial setting, as studies of IV vitamin C therapies in patients with sepsis have not found benefit (84) (85) (91) (92) and adverse events (93) (94) (95) and interference with glucometer readings (96) (97) have been reported.",

                    "Ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant to protect against oxidative damage from free radicals (46). It inactivates nitric oxide and improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation (47), and acts via different mechanisms depending on its plasma concentration. Plasma concentrations <0.1mM are achieved through oral intake of dietary or supplemental forms. At pharmacologic plasma concentrations of 0.3 - 20mM via intravenous injection, ascorbic acid is oxidized to an ascorbate radical which acts as a prodrug for hydrogen peroxide formation within interstitial fluids (33). This induces DNA damage and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and triggers ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in cancer cells (67).",

In leukemic cells, vitamin C compensated for Tet2 mutations to restore normal function (78). In non-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma cells, pharmacological ascorbate selectively sensitized these cells (79). Ascorbate decreases colon cancer cell proliferation by downregulating specificity proteins (48). It also depletes ATP and induces autophagy and cell death in prostate cancer cells (49). Preferential oxidative cytotoxic effects on cancer cells may be due to the presence of intracellular iron (50), copper (51), an increase in p53 activity (52), and overexpression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (53). Further, high-dose vitamin C was reported to inhibit metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (82).",

                "clinical_summary": [
                    "Vitamin D refers to several forms of fat-soluble vitamins found in fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, and fish. The two forms utilized in humans are ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3). Sunlight can promote the synthesis of D3 in the skin. Vitamin D maintains serum calcium and phosphorus levels by regulating their absorption and excretion, and is important for bone formation. Other biologic functions include its role as an antiproliferative agent (1), and as a pro-differentiation hormone (2) with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties (3). Low levels of vitamin D are associated with a greater risk of mortality (13), may affect cardiovascular health (14), and increase the risk for development of multiple sclerosis in women (74), but a large study found no association between lower levels and cognitive function (15). However, deficiency during pregnancy may affect neurocognitive development in newborns (75). Deficiency can also cause rickets or other bone disorders, and may be a risk factor for extraskeletal diseases (45). Lower D levels may occur due to time of year or living in northern climates (9); in non-Caucasian race (46) or obese individuals (47); with chronic use of steroids or anticonvulsants; or with diseases such as autoimmune disorders (3), cystic fibrosis (48), kidney disease, and cancer (46) (48) (49).",
                    "Although some studies suggest vitamin D improves bone mineral density and prevents fractures in the elderly (4) (5) and in postmenopausal women (6), high-dose vitamin D had no benefit on lower extremity function and was associated with an increased fall risk in older adults (64). Safety concerns also arose with doses of 1000 IU/d or higher in older persons who had elevated fall risk and low serum D levels (99). In addition, data are conflicting for primary fracture prevention in other populations (7) (8) (9), and a meta-analysis did not find benefit for preventing fractures or falls, or for bone mineral density (100).",
                    "In healthy adults, D3 also does not appear to decrease fall risk (101) and high-dose supplementation did not benefit bone health (92), with 4000 or 10,000 IU compared with 400 IU resulting in greater bone mineral density loss in healthy vitamin D-sufficient women, but not men (93). Recent US Preventive Services Task Force reports also found no associations between vitamin D supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence for community-dwelling older adults (79) (80), and another study failed to find associations between vitamin D status and chronic pain (88).",
                    "Findings on whether vitamin D protects against cardiovascular (CV) risk factors have varied across populations and regimens. In a Women\u2019s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D and hormone therapy had a greater effect than either intervention alone or placebo (67), but vitamin D did not improve CV risk factors or physical function in a large long-term trial of older adults (68), and meta-analyses also found no effect on vascular function markers (81) nor reduction in CV disease endpoints (94). Yet in another placebo-controlled trial, supplementation benefited diabetic patients with coronary artery disease who were vitamin D-deficient (69). In addition, a single large dose of vitamin D2 improved endothelial function in type-2 diabetic patients (11). In non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, D3 was more effective than D2 in raising serum D levels (70). Dietary vitamin D intake was shown to be inversely associated with mortality from stroke (76), but supplementation was not associated with reduced all-cause mortality in critically ill patients (102), and did not reduce risk of atrial fibrillation (103).",
                    "In other trials, vitamin D did not significantly reduce upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in healthy adults (16), or infections/antibiotic use in the elderly (17), or prevent viral URTIs in children (71). However, it may protect against influenza (78) and reduce wheezing in some infants (82). Vitamin D was not helpful for mild psoriasis (83) or seasonal affective disorder (18) (19). Supplementation may reduce relapse risk in Crohn\u2019s disease (12), and D3 plus calcium may have a small effect on postmenopausal weight gain (10). A single oral high-dose of D3 significantly improved fatigue in healthy persons who were vitamin D-deficient (72). Supplementation may also improve sexual function in women with sexual dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency (89), but a large study did not find any benefits of long-term supplementation for preventing depression in healthy adults (96). In a small study, higher serum levels of vitamin D were associated with increased beneficial gut bacteria and decreased pathogenic bacteria (95).",
                    "Vitamin D has also been examined for its anticancer potential. In animal models, dietary vitamin D3 exerted chemopreventive effects against breast cancer equivalent to those elicited by calcitriol without causing hypercalcemia (20). In humans, vitamin D from sunlight exposure and dietary intake may have protective effects against breast cancer (21) (22), and insufficiency among breast cancer patients is high (23). In postmenopausal women not on estrogen therapy, vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce colorectal cancer incidence (24) (25). In women with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, long-term supplementation resulted in regression and improved metabolic status (66). However, in a large trial of healthy postmenopausal women with mean vitamin D levels above those of the US population, taking vitamin D3 plus calcium did not lower cancer risk after 4 years of supplementation (73); and vitamin D supplementation did not prevent aromatase-induced arthralgia (97). In addition, even though pooled analyses found associations between higher serum D levels and lower risks of breast and colon cancers (85) (86), other analyses have not found preventive effects against cancer with high-dose supplementation (87), and contributing factors such as better diet and lifestyle habits may also be at play.",
                    "In older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, supplementation normalized vitamin D levels and enhanced efficacy of rituximab (27). Active vitamin D compounds may also decrease incidence of post-transplant malignancy among kidney transplant recipients (28).",
                    "Other data reveal that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in advanced pancreatic cancer (42) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (43), and that CRC patients with higher blood 25(OH)D concentrations have better survival (84). A meta-analysis of vitamin D supplementation on CRC survival outcomes also suggests clinically meaningful benefit (104). In patients with metastatic CRC, addition of high-dose vitamin D3 to chemotherapy resulted in statistically insignificant progression-free survival but improved supportive hazard ratio (90). Increased vitamin D intake reduced CRC risk (29) (31) (32) (33), but had no effect on colorectal adenomas (65). Data on benefits to reduce skin cancer risk (38) (105) and advanced cancers (106) are mixed. Vitamin D did not have a protective effect against non-Hodgkin lymphoma (34), ovarian (35), kidney (36), endometrial (37), esophageal or gastric (39) cancers, or improve relapse-free survival in patients with digestive tract cancers (91), and may significantly increase risk of pancreatic (40) or aggressive prostate cancer (41). In addition, data from meta-analyses are conflicting on whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce cancer incidence or mortality (44) (77) (94).",
                    "Oral supplementation has been shown to be the safest way to increase vitamin D levels (51), although debate continues on how this may translate to optimizing vitamin D status (45). The Institute of Medicine recommends a Daily Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 600 IU/day with the Upper Level Intake at 4,000 IU/day for bone health (50), although safety concerns have been noted with higher doses in some populations (99). Also, combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation has been associated with increased kidney stone incidence (7) (80). Therefore, patients should consult with their physicians if a deficiency is suspected to assess the amount of vitamin D needed for health maintenance and to avoid side effects."

In humans, the primary function of vitamin D is to maintain normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations by enhancing small intestine dietary absorption efficiency of these minerals. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] enhances the efficiency of calcium and phosphorus absorption along the entire small intestine, but primarily in the duodenum and jejunum (5). When dietary calcium intake is insufficient, 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) mobilize monocytic stem cells in the bone marrow to become mature osteoclasts. These osteoclasts mobilize calcium from the bones, thereby maintaining blood calcium levels (50). Vitamin D is thought to have physiological effects in other parts of the body as well because vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are found in the cells of other organs that include intestines, kidney, stomach, brain, prostate, breast, and white blood cells (2) (53).",
                    "The anticancer effect of vitamin D is thought to be due to induction of cell differentiation (1) (54) and antiproliferation (55). In lymphoma cells, interventional 25(OH)D3 to normalize levels (>30 ng/mL) resulted in significantly stronger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting benefit in D-deficient individuals receiving rituximab (27). In xenograft models of breast cancer, dietary D3 elevated circulating D levels and increased CYP27B1 expression in both tumor and intestines, suggesting it stimulates local calcitriol synthesis in the tumor microenvironment and promotes the ensuing paracrine/autocrine actions that contribute to its anticancer activity (20). The upregulation of CYP27B1 expression by tumors was unique to D3 versus calcitriol in the same tissue (20). In other animal models, a positive feedback signaling loop between the serine-protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and the VDR was identified as critical for cancer chemoprevention by vitamin D (56).",
                    "Calcitriol, the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, targets the vitamin D degrading enzyme CYP24A1, which is most abundant in the kidney, but also expressed in several other tissues (57). CYP24A1 overexpression in colon, ovary, breast, lung, and esophageal malignancies, likely leads to degradation of the locally available D3, impairing its antitumorigenic action in the tumor tissue (57)."

Alpha-tocopherol reportedly causes inhibition of protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. Vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules to decrease adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium.

It consists of eight herbs: Bupleuri radix (Chai Hu), Angelicae radix (Dang Gui or Dong Quai), Paeoniae radix alba (Bai Shao), Atractylodis rhizome macrocephalae (Bai Zhu), Poria cocos (Fu Ling), Zingiberis siccatum rhizome (Sheng Jiang), Menthae haplocalycis (Bo He), and Glycyrrhizae radix (Gan Cao or Licorice). Xiao Yao San has a long history of use as a treatment for depression, anxiety and stress.",
                    "A modified version known as Dan Zhi XYS or Jia Wei XYS was developed with two additional herbs with cooling properties, Cortex Moutan (Mu Dan Pi) and Fructus Gardeniae (Zhi Zi). This formulation is used both in China and Japan to manage symptoms such as mood, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia associated with climacteric syndrome. Jia Wei XYS is also the most prescribed product for breast cancer patients according to the Taiwan health insurance research database (1). In addition, a large retrospective study found that Jia Wei XYS was frequently utilized (nearly a third of all herbal prescriptions) by breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. The authors reported notable reductions in the risk of endometrial cancer along with improvements in tamoxifen-induced side effects although improvements affected by Jia Wei XYS were statistically non-significant (2).",

                    "In a systematic review conducted in 2012, 26 randomized clinical trials involving 1,837 depressive patients were assessed. The interventions employed included XYS or its modified forms, XYS plus antidepressants such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics and tetracyclics, with antidepressants as controls.  Primary outcomes included the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores. Data showed that XYS and its modified forms combined with antidepressants were superior to antidepressants alone. The formulae also improved the HAMD scores without increasing the number of adverse events (3).\n\nIn another review (5 XYS studies, 1,260 participants), Butler et al., concluded that despite some positive findings, the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for depression cannot be fully substantiated (4). But growing evidence since then suggests otherwise. A meta-analysis (40 trials with 3,549 that included 11 XYS studies) showed that CHM led to better clinical outcomes based on HAMD scores. Furthermore, adding CHM to conventional treatments reduced the adverse effects associated with their use; CHM alone also caused fewer adverse events compared with antidepressants (5). An additional review (4 XYS trials with 1,441 gastric, lung, esophageal, breast and liver cancer patients) yielded similar findings. Compared to conventional antidepressants, CHM users experienced fewer adverse events of functional gastrointestinal disorders, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, and fatigue.  However, the authors did not perform subgroup analysis for the different cancer types or disease stage (6).",
                    "In the latest analysis, Yang et al., assessed 55 studies (that included 12 XYS trials) involving 5,572 participants. Of these, 30 trials compared CHM vs SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline) whereas 25 compared CHM + SSRIs vs SSRIs.  Although the studies were of poor quality, CHM (with or without SSRIs) was associated with statistically significant improvements in HAMD scores with fewer, less severe adverse events (7).",
                    "Anxiety",
                    "Both XYS and Jia Wei XYS have been studied for potential anxiolytic effects. A systematic review and meta-analysis (9 trials with 681 patients) reported that XYS, alone or in combination with western medicine, helps improve sleep quality and relieve anxiety (23).",
                    "In an 8-week multi-center trial, Su et al., randomized 191 patients with mild to moderate depression and anxiety to receive Jia Wei XYS or sertraline. Primary outcomes included HAMD, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Clinical Global Impression Scale scores. Jia Wei XYS was comparable to sertraline in all outcomes at the 8-week assessment, with sustained benefits at the 12-week follow-up. This suggests that the anti-depressive and anti-anxiolytic effects of Jia Wei XYS are more durable than those of sertraline. Jia Wei XYS was also associated with lower adverse event rate at the 12-week follow-up (8).",
                    "Insomnia",
                    "Data show that 40-60% of patients with mood disorders develop insomnia before developing symptoms associated with mood disorders (9). In the trial described above (8), the authors reported that in addition to improving anxiety, Jia Wei XYS also affected reductions in symptoms of sleep disorder at the 12-week follow up. Furthermore, in patients with psychological stress insomnia, Jia Wei XYS, used alone or in combination with the benzodiazepene estazolam, affected subjective improvements in sleep quality (10).",
                    "Although accumulating evidence suggests benefits of both XYS and Jia Wei XYS, majority of the above mentioned studies are limited by small sample sizes, risk of bias, variations in treatment duration and dosage, and medication compliance. Larger methodologically robust trials are needed to determine the therapeutic potential of these formulations."

Antimicrobial activity has been suggested in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa model, wherein a water extract of YNBY reduced bacterial virulence by affecting quorum-sensing signaling and reducing biofilm formation (5).\n\nIn other studies, notoginsenoside Ft1, a saponin constituent, induced platelet aggregation by binding to platelet P2Y12 receptors (3). It demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophil function and NO and PGE2 production through reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression (10). In peritoneal macrophages, notoginseng had a bidirectional regulatory effect, inhibiting COX-2 expression at an early stage and elevating it at a later stage (22). Data also suggest it can inhibit expression of NF-kappaB activity and TNF-alpha mRNA (12). Notoginseng may play a role in periodontal disease treatment by suppressing MMP-2 expression and by inhibiting breakdown of bone tissue (9).

However, inhalation toxicity is readily demonstrated (7), and erionite, a type of airborne fibrous zeolite, has been associated with high incidence of malignant mesothelioma (8) (9) (10) (11), and geologic occurrences of erionite are emerging as a concern for respiratory illness in the United States.",

A small pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer of a proprietary oral zeolite supplement in immunodeficient patients suggests some immunomodulatory effects (16); and as an adjunct to standard treatment, a zeolite formulation reduced symptoms of neuroendocrine tumor-related diarrhea (30), but no additional studies validate these claims. In an Alzheimer\u2019s mouse model, zeolite reduced oxidative damage and plaque generation (17). Animal studies suggest that micronized zeolite may have anticancer benefits (18) (19); and ameliorates malignant mesothelioma caused by asbestos toxicity (31). But these findings also have not translated into any further research. Currently, no studies of zeolite as a cancer treatment in humans have been published.",

It is essential for the structural formation of biologically active molecules such as copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), and enzymes including RNA polymerases, alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, and alkaline phosphatase that depend on zinc as a cofactor (26) (45) (46). Zinc influences protein kinase C activity, immunocompetence, apoptosis, and metallothionein levels and has a number of antioxidant and antiinflammatory functions (9) (16) (45) (47) (48). However, whether zinc elicits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or antiapoptotic effects is concentration-dependent and relies on an intricate balance. Under conditions of zinc overload or deficiency, zinc ions become pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, and proapoptotic (46).",
                    "The role of zinc in taste perception likely relates to the presence of alkaline phosphatase within the taste-bud membrane (49). Zinc accumulation in bone tissue activates alkaline phosphatase and stimulates collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, which are involved in bone mineralization and calcification (50). Zinc has the ability to complex with viral coat proteins, altering assembly of viral particles (51), and its deficiency increases humoral and cell-mediated immunity dysfunction and susceptibility to infection (47). Supplemental zinc can reduce the ability of the rhinovirus to attach to the human respiratory tract (6). In patients with a common cold, zinc decreases plasma soluble interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1fa) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), a cellular receptor for rhinovirus (4). In men with reduced sperm motility, zinc supplementation reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis, and sperm DNA fragmentation (27).",

In vitro, intracellular zinc accumulation inhibits proliferation of human prostate cancer cells by causing G2/M arrest and upregulating CDKN1A gene expression, which expresses p21 (54) (55). Further, zinc deficiency depresses nuclear p21 and p53 levels (56). Animal models of esophageal cancer demonstrate that zinc-deficiency induces overexpression of proinflammatory mediators S100a8 and S100a9 as well as chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines, and Cox-2 (32) (33). Zinc replenishment reduces and also reverses these proinflammatory signatures (33).",

In preclinical studies, Zyflamend inhibits proliferation of oral squamous carcinoma (3), pancreatic cancer (4), and melanoma (5), as well as cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (15). In an animal model, it inhibited growth of both hormone-sensitive/insensitive prostate cancer, and reduced expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) (6). It also suppressed elevated levels of proinflammatory mediators and aromatase in obese models (7) and significantly reduced adipose tissue in mice (16).",
                    "Studies in humans are quite limited. In a phase I trial in men with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, Zyflamend did not cause any serious adverse events, and significant reductions in serum C-reactive protein and nuclear factor-kappa B levels were observed (8). There have also been a few cases of clinical response to combination therapy that included a Zyflamend regimen in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (17). More studies are warranted to evaluate safety and effectiveness.",

                    "In vitro, Zyflamend inhibited inflammatory enzymes, decreased retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (10), and induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells (2) (3) (4) (11). It also reduced androgen receptor signaling and enhanced bicalutamide-induced apoptosis (9). Other studies in prostate cancer cell lines suggest that Zyflamend inhibits class I and class II histone deacetylase expression, upregulates p21 expression (13), and regulates upstream kinases LKB1 and CaMKK2 via AMPK activation (14).",
                    "In melanoma cells, Zyflamend induced autophagy and apoptosis sequentially by activating the intrinsic caspase cascade. Cell migration and COX-2 expression were also suppressed (5). It also inhibited NF-kappa B activation in myeloid leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma (2), pancreatic (4), and cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (15). In leukoplakia and skin cell lines, both Zyflamend and carnosol, an antioxidant phenolic constituent, inhibited mutagenesis via Hsp90 ATPase inhibition, which led to reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor levels and CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 suppression (12).",
                    "Both a cellular model of obesity-related inflammation and an obese animal model indicate that Zyflamend blocks proinflammatory mediators and aromatase induction as well as Akt and NF-kB activation. Increased aromatase mRNA levels and mammary gland activity were also partially inhibited (7). Reduction of adiposity was attributed to AMPK activation (16).",
                    "In a murine xenograft model of prostate cancer, Zyflamend inhibited androgen-dependent tumor growth and histone deacetylase-5, biomarkers linked to prostate cancer progression (6). It also reduced the number of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia and dysplasia, and tumor incidence and number, and inhibited cell proliferation in an animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma (3)."
