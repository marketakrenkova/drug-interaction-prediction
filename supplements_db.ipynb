It lacks a relation to grape, however; the name Oregon grape originated from the purple clusters of berries that resemble grapes in appearance. It is a close relative of barberry, Berberis vulgaris . The rhizome, root, and bark, which are odorless and bitter, are collected in autumn to be used medicinally.

Kava extracts have been used safely in clinical trials under medical supervision for up to 6 months ( 2092 , 2093 , 2094 , 2095 , 4032 , 7325 , 15046 , 15130 , 18314 , 18316 )( 18318 , 18320 , 29663 , 29671 ). Historically, there has been some concern that kava preparations could induce hepatotoxicity and liver failure in patients taking relatively normal doses, short-term. At least 100 cases of liver toxicity following kava use have been reported. In some cases, the use of kava for as little as one to three months resulted in the need for liver transplants, and even death ( 390 , 7024 , 7068 , 7086 , 7096 , 17086 , 57232 , 57239 , 57251 , 57252 )( 57254 , 57281 , 57274 , 57297 , 57337 ). As a result of these concerns, kava was withdrawn from European markets and Canada in the early 2000s ( 11371 , 57245 , 57259 , 57264 , 57265 , 57306 , 57331 ). However, some experts question the clinical validity of several of the cases of liver toxicity ( 11369 , 11371 ). Furthermore, in 2012 and 2015, the market withdrawals of kava were lifted in Canada and Germany after re-evaluation of kava suggested that the risk of hepatotoxicity was minimal and the supplement may be safer than certain alternative treatments ( 91593 , 91594 , 91615 ).

Kavalactones in kava are thought to be the active constituent that produces skeletal muscle relaxation, non-narcotic anesthesia, and local anesthetic effects. Clinical data suggest moderate benefits with kava as short-term use for generalized anxiety disorder (39), and no differences in withdrawal or addiction versus placebo (40). Several other studies also support the use of kava for relieving anxiety (1) (25) (26). It has further been suggested as an alternative to benzodiazepines, which are used to treat anxiety. However, an internet-based study suggests that kava is not superior to placebo in reducing anxiety (3), and a randomized clinical trial reported similar findings (36). Although a systematic review showed that kava does not have negative effects on cognition (37), there have been case reports of impairment consistent with CNS depressant effects, including slow, slurred speech and flaccid muscle tone (45). In addition, due to concerns of hepatotoxicity, the Canadian, French, and British governments withdrew availability of kava and kava-containing products (4) (11) (23). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised consumers about the potential risks of liver injury associated with kava consumption. However, following a World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to study aqueous extracts of kava, initial research results support the benefits of kava (27) (28). Case analyses of 14 patients with hepatic injury resulting from kava use revealed low-quality products, overdose, prolonged use and co-medication as causative factors (29). Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings. Kava consumption has been associated with low cancer incidence (30), but one of its constituents was shown to stimulate growth of melanoma cells (31).',\n",

Lavender oil inhalation reversed spatial memory loss in dementia models (23). Clinical studies have shown benefits of oral lavender preparations against depression (7) (43) and anxiety (12) (13) (16) (18) (41) (42). Findings of lavender aromatherapy indicate improvements in preoperative anxiety (68) (69), reduction in postoperative analgesics (45) and autonomic response to pain (46). It was also reported to reduce pain and anxiety in burn patients (70), and pain from labor (71) or renal colic (72). Studies using inhaled lavender found improvements in sleep quality (36), post-acute-stress memory and physiologic function (73), dysmenorrhea and emotional symptoms (37) (38), premenstrual syndrome (75), menopause flushing (74), reduced migraine frequency (19), and agitation and falls in older individuals (20). Inhaled lavender was also shown effective in improving symptoms of dementia (5) (15) compared to dermal application (39). Aromatherapy massage with lavender affected psychological and physiological improvements in patients with acute coronary syndrome (76). Preclinical findings suggest anticancer effects of lavender against various cancer cell lines (47) (48) (49). Animal studies that employed the monocyclic terpene perillyl alcohol (POH), derived from several herbs including lavender, showed tumor inhibition and regression (50) (51).

       " 'Borage oil, derived from the seeds of the plant, is a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and linoleic acid (LA). In herbal and traditional medicine, borage oil has been used to induce sweating, as an expectorant and anti-inflammatory, to promote lactation, to stimulate adrenal function, and as an alternative source to evening primrose oil for obtaining GLA (13). It has also been promoted to treat rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, diabetic neuropathy, menopause-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal disease (14) (15). In vitro and in vivo studies suggest antimutagenic and cytotoxic effects (16). In an animal model of senile osteoporosis, a diet rich in borage or fish oils restored inflammation and bone parameters (17). Borage extract consumption improved markers of disease-induced cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s models (18). In humans, studies show that GLA from borage seed oil has some benefits in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (7) (9). A long-term study evaluating fish and borage seed oils in RA patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease suggest these may be useful to correct dyslipidemia when used either alone or in combination (19). Other analyses suggest moderate evidence of GLA-containing oils including borage oil for the relief of RA symptoms such as pain intensity and disability without increased adverse events, but adequate dose and treatment duration are unknown (20), and there was not enough available evidence to support their current use in RA management (21). Studies are mixed on the effect of borage oil for skin conditions such as atopic eczema (11) (12) and infantile seborrheic dermatitis (5). Several analyses indicate that neither evening primrose oil nor borage oil are effective in treating atopic eczema, with improvements being similar to respective placebos (22) (23). A combination of seed oils from borage and echium (a plant rich in linolenic acid) produced anti-inflammatory effects in patients with mild asthma (24). In patients with early-stage type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, this combined supplementation also significantly lowered total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (25). Borage oil contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic (26). Risk of hepatic damage increases with length of exposure and cumulative dose consumed. Patients should use borage oil certified free of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Borage oil may be unsafe during pregnancy (27).',\n",

Bilberry anthocyanins modulated oxidative stress defense enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (2). In vitro and in vivo, bilberry inhibited angiogenesis through inhibition of ERK 1/2 and Akt phosphorylation (4). In an animal model of uveitis and retinal inflammation, pretreatment with a bilberry extract prevented photoreceptor impairment, relieved intracellular ROS elevation, activated retinal NF-ĸB in the inflamed retina, and suppressed the decrease of rhodopsin via inhibition of IL-6, which activates STAT3, thereby protecting outer segment length in photoreceptor cells (3). In a monocytic cell line, quercetin, epicatechin, and resveratrol inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-kappaB activation (14). In individuals with hypercholesterolemia, anthocyanins may improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating the NO-cGMP signaling pathway (28). The polyphenols in bilberry juice can modulate inflammation by decreasing plasma C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, -15, and monokine induced by INFγ (MIG) (14).

In vitro, maca or its constituents have demonstrated antiviral (17), antioxidant (18), anti-inflammatory, analgesic, or neuroprotective (19) activities. Animal studies indicate that maca increases endurance (6), enhances sexual function (2) (5), and improves scopolamine-induced memory deficits (14). It also demonstrated antidepressant (20) and postmenopausal hormone-modulating (21) effects. Only a few small trials have evaluated maca for its effects in humans. Maca consumption was associated with lower serum IL-6 levels and higher health status (22). In men, maca supplementation increased libido (3), sperm production and motility (4), and enhanced subjective sexual well-being (11). Another preliminary study suggests it may also improve athletic performance (23). In women, several studies suggest that maca improves both antidepressant- and menopause-induced sexual dysfunction (12) (24) (25) (26). A study in Chinese postmenopausal women showed neither hormonal nor immunological effects, but did appear to reduce depressive symptoms and diastolic blood pressure (27).

It is necessary for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and its role as a mobile electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron-transfer processes of respiration and coupled phosphorylation is well established. It also has a direct regulatory role on succinyl and NADH dehydrogenases (1). CoQ10 has been shown to scavenge free radicals produced by lipid peroxidation and prevent mitochondrial deformity during ischemic episodes, and may help maintain integrity of myocardial calcium ion channels during ischemic insults (2). CoQ10 may also stabilize cellular membranes and prevent depletion of metabolites required for ATP resynthesis (10), and suppress age-related inflammatory reactions and osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting oxidative stress (30). One of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of CoQ10 involves inhibition of microglia in pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling epilepsy in mice (40). Other preclinical studies suggest CoQ10 can prevent reduced glucose transporter-4 protein levels in adipocytes caused by simvastatin, which may contribute to the risk of new-onset diabetes in statin patients (31).

Theories for its mechanism include interference with endothelial cell migration and adhesion via modification of adhesion protein organization and inhibition of collagenase (18). A murine glioma model suggests that induction of t-PA plays an essential role (19). Intraperitoneal administration suppresses sarcoma-180 growth and B16-F10 melanoma metastasis in mice (9) (11), but oral bioavailability is questionable based on the results of mouse models (20). The manufacturers of Neovastat (AE-941), a shark cartilage extract, report that this formulation inhibits embryonic vascularization (21), endothelial cell proliferation (22), tubulogenesis, VEGF binding to endothelial cells, VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor, and the VEGF-dependent increase in vascular permeability in vitro. They also claim that it inhibits serine elastase and matrix metalloproteinase activity (23). Oral administration of Neovastat has produced anti-tumor effects in mouse models (10). A diet containing the acidic ethanol-precipitate-fraction of a water extract of shark cartilage significantly increased serum inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and reduced the number of adenocarcinomas in the pancreatic duct in a hamster model (24).',\n",
       " 'Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, cellular signal transduction, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and bone formation (1) (2). It also helps regulate blood pressure and enzymes such as those that control intracellular calcium and potassium, and is essential for normal heart functioning (1) (3). The dietary form can be found in many foods, and especially in dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and fish (4). In dietary supplements, other over-the-counter products, and pharmaceutical preparations, magnesium is combined with another substance such as a salt or acid, and has specific therapeutic uses. The carbonate, hydroxide, and oxide forms are found in antacid and laxative products whereas citrate is used as a laxative before diagnostic procedures or surgery of the colon. The chloride, gluconate, lactate, and sulfate forms are clinically used to treat magnesium deficiency. Both dietary and supplemental forms have been studied widely for their potential role in chronic ailments such as heart disease and diabetes. Dietary intake is associated with reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease, especially for women (5). It is also associated with reduced risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), although studies have been mixed and more affirmative for the effect of serum magnesium on SCD (6) (7). It may help reduce the risk of ischemic stroke (8), metabolic syndrome (9) (10), type 2 diabetes (11) and insulin resistance (12), asthma (13), and osteoporosis (1), but findings from studies on depression are conflicting (14) (15). Other studies also have not linked dietary consumption with cancer incidence and mortality (16), or pancreatic cancer risk (17), but have associated higher intake with a lower risk for colorectal tumors (18) and lung cancer (19). Additional studies are needed to confirm these effects. Magnesium supplementation has been evaluated for a variety of health conditions. Oral intake may increase survival in patients with heart failure (20) (21), and improve insulin sensitivity in healthy adults (22) (77), and in those with diabetes (77). In a study of overweight individuals, supplementation resulted in changes in gene expression and other positive effects on metabolic pathways (23). Some studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure following supplementation (24) (25), but an earlier systematic review suggests the positive findings are due to poor trial design and short duration (26). Also in contrast, data from a large, community-based cohort did not show low serum levels to be a risk factor for developing hypertension or cardiovascular disease (27). Other studies of oral supplements have demonstrated positive effects on bone mass accrual in healthy adolescents with inadequate intake (28), and suppressed bone turnover in postmenopausal osteoporotic women (29). In adults with asthma, supplementation improved objective measures of airway resistance and subjective measures of asthma control and quality of life (13); in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis, it has improved respiratory muscle strength (30). There is also moderate evidence for its use in migraine headache and prophylaxis (31). Although preliminary data have shown mixed results with oral supplementation for premenstrual syndrome (32), a pilot study indicates that it reduces menopausal hot flashes in breast cancer patients (33), and a systematic review supports its use for leg cramps during pregnancy (34). Larger studies are needed to elucidate conflicting results and clarify the roles for supplementation across various health conditions. Many adults, particularly African-Americans (35) and the elderly (9), may not have adequate dietary intakes of magnesium. However, true deficiency most often occurs with critical illness including cardiac conditions and preeclampsia, as well as gastrointestinal and renal conditions, poorly-controlled diabetes, and alcoholism (3). In addition, certain medications including calcineurin inhibitors (36), high-dose antivirals (37), and the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (38), as well as some cancer therapy regimens (39) (40) and surgical procedures (41) (42), may also cause hypomagnesemia. If deficiency is suspected, patients should be evaluated by their treating physician to determine the extent of inadequate intake and its effective management, as well as to avoid potential drug interactions or magnesium toxicity. Hypermagnesemia is rare and results from failure to excrete magnesium or because of excessive intake. It may especially occur in patients with gastrointestinal or renal dysfunction, and have serious effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, depression of tendon reflexes, and other cardiovascular and neuromuscular manifestations (43) (44).',\n",

       " 'Escin, also known as Aescin, a natural mixture of triterpenoid saponins isolated from the seed of the horse chestnut has been identified as the active principle. The anti-inflammatory effects of escin involve significant downregulation of expression of certain inflammatory genes, and upregulation of expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which also confers neuroprotection (1). One of the mechanisms by which escin reduces chronic venous insufficiency is thought to be via inhibition of elastase and hyaluronidase, both involved in enzymatic proteoglycan degradation, which constitutes part of the capillary endothelium and is also the main component of the extravascular matrix (19). The contraction of veins and arteries by horse chestnut is believed, partially, to be mediated through 5-HT(2A) receptors; horse chestnut also reduced platelet aggregation in vitro (20). Beta-aescin and 5-fluorouracil were reported to inhibit human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells, which may be due to the synergistic effects including cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, activation of caspases-3, 8 and 9, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression (17). In another study, escin was shown to potentiate the efficacy of gemcitabine, partially due to the inhibition of the nuclear transcription factor (NF-κB) activity and consequent inhibition of c-Myc, COX-2, Cyclin D1, Survivin, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and the activation of caspase-3 (18).',\n",
       " 'Lycopene is a natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Referred to as a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, it is not known to have any vitamin A activity. Biological actions include antioxidant activity via singlet oxygen quenching and peroxyl radical scavenging, induction of cell to cell communication, and growth control, although this appears to occur with less efficiency than with beta-carotene (15). Preventive consumption of lycopene attenuated effects of acetaminophen-induced liver injury in a murine model (29). Proposed mechanisms of cancer-preventive effects include inhibition of cancer growth, induction of differentiation by modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, alterations in insulin-like growth factor-1 (16) or vascular endothelial growth factor (17) levels, prevention of oxidative DNA damage, and possible enhancement of carcinogen metabolizing enzymes (18). In human liver adenocarcinoma cells, antimetastatic activity was attributed to downregulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which produces reactive oxygen species (30). Other possible mechanisms for all carotenoids include immune enhancement as well as inhibition of mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions. Carotenoids are also associated with decreased risk for macular degeneration and cataracts, and some types of cancers and cardiovascular events (19).',\n",

Calcium reserves are found mostly in the bones, helping to maintain skeletal structure. The association of supplemental but not dietary calcium with increased cardiovascular risk could be related to their differing, acute effects on serum calcium (45). Calcium supplementation may fail to compensate for renal calcium loss, resulting in increased circulatory calcium that could lead to coronary artery deposits (46). Reduced dietary calcium may cause calcium depletion in membrane storage sites resulting in less stability of vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, as optimal concentrations stabilize these membranes, inhibit calcium entry into cells, and reduce vasoconstriction (47). Other researchers suggest that gastrointestinal events associated with calcium supplements may account for an increase in self-reported cardiovascular events (18). Observed associations of dairy with overall prostate cancer risk may be related to the modulation of vitamin D metabolism by calcium and phosphorus (15) (31). Saturated fat in whole dairy correlating with higher C-peptide concentrations, along with obesity and hyperinsulinemia are proposed for associations of whole milk with fatal prostate cancer (31). Other suggested mechanisms include increasing levels of ionized calcium in the blood, as prostate cancer cells express both calcium-sensing receptors and calcium-dependent voltage-gated channels, the stimulation of which by extracellular calcium increases prostate cancer cell growth (44) (35). In African American men, positive associations between calcium and aggressive prostate cancer have been linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDX-2 binding site of the VDR gene (32).',\n",

Chrysin has also been identified among the bioactive metabolites with central nervous system (CNS) suppression activity (21). In vitro, modulation of the GABA system by passionflower includes affinity to GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, and effects on GABA uptake (24). Antiradical activities observed are attributed to flavonoids such as isovitexin (25). An isolated benzoflavone moiety is suspected as being the strongest aromatase inhibitor in passionflower, although the flavone chrysin also has these properties (26). In an animal reproductive and developmental study, passionflower produced sexual behavioral disruption in male adult rats that was not accompanied by alterations in plasma testosterone levels, reproductive-related organs, and glands weights or sperm count, and was potentially attributed to aromatase inhibition (27). In seizure models, protection against post-ictal depression not seen with diazepam controls point to activity from metabolites in passionflower rather than as a result of its seizure suppression effects (21).

It is involved in the formation of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine (28). Decreased SAM-e levels in cerebrospinal fluid are thought to contribute to the etiologies of depression and Alzheimer’s disease (29) (30). SAM-e levels may also be decreased in chronic liver disease (31) and AIDS-associated myelopathy (32). In the United States, SAM-e is marketed as a supplement to enhance mood, brain and neural function, joint mobility, and liver detoxification. It is also a prescription drug in other countries. Preclinical data suggest that SAM-e may have antidepressive (33), neuroprotective (34), anti-inflammatory (35), and chondroprotective (36) effects. Other models suggest liver injury can be exacerbated by depleted SAM-e levels, and that supplementation may have hepatoprotective effects (31). In humans, data on whether SAM-e is an effective adjunct for major depressive disorder are mixed (16) (27), and a large trial did not find benefit with SAM-e over escitalopram or placebo for major depressive disorder (37). Another study suggests benefit compared with escitalopram or placebo (20), but its therapeutic potential may be greater in men (21). A Cochrane review cites an absence of quality evidence (22), while a meta-analysis suggests adjunctive potential (23). Other preliminary data suggest SAM-e may improve memory-related cognitive symptoms in depressed patients (17). However, studies that suggest cognitive benefits for patients with Alzheimer’s disease do not evaluate SAM-e in isolation (28). Although results are mixed, a few clinical trials of SAM-e for osteoarthritis suggest benefit comparable with NSAIDs (14) (15) (38). For hot flashes, SAM-e was ineffective compared with historical placebo (39). It also did not significantly improve neurological measures in patients with AIDS-associated myelopathy (32). Preliminary trials suggest some benefit in fibromyalgia patients (40) (41), but larger studies are needed. Some trials have suggested benefit with oral SAM-e in patients with chronic liver disease (42). Addition of oral SAM-e to injected pegylated interferon alpha (pegIFN alpha) and oral ribavirin improved viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C (18). Postoperative intravenous SAM-e therapy improved residual liver function in patients with cirrhosis (19). However, in patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis at elevated risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, oral SAM-e did not improve liver function, or reduce injury or oxidative stress (24). A small open-label study suggests oral SAM-e may be useful as adjunctive palliative therapy in patients with advanced biliary tract carcinoma (25). Other preliminary analyses suggest protective effects with SAM-e against chemotherapy-induced liver toxicity (43) (44) (45). Additional confirmatory studies are needed to assess efficacy and safety. While generally well-tolerated, the therapeutic value of SAM-e in chronic liver disease is limited (26) or yet to be determined. Because it is poorly absorbed, enteric-coated tablets are preferred. Outside the United States, parenteral formulations are used to treat fibromyalgia (9), osteoarthritis, and tendonitis as well as depression.

In clinical studies, flaxseed improved mild menopausal symptoms (11) and exerted chemoprotective effects in postmenopausal women (2). It affected moderate reductions in estrogens and androgens in postmenopausal women (24), and may also benefit women with polycystic ovarian syndrome by reducing androgen levels (23). Flaxseed powder along with Vitex agnus may help to reduce cyclical mastalgia (39). In other studies, supplementation with a major lignan derived from flaxseed improved glycemic control in Type-2 diabetic patients (13).

       " 'The active constituents of andrographis are diterpenoid lactones known as andrographolides (10) (11). They exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting nitric oxide production and cyclooxygenase-2 expression (26). In mouse hepatocytes, andrographis induced mRNA expression of P450 subfamily members, CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, in a concentration-dependent manner (31). In other studies, andrographis extract demonstrated a calcium channel inhibition effect that can cause smooth muscle relaxation and decrease blood pressure and heart rate (32), as well as relaxation of the uterus (33). It also showed antiplatelet effects by inhibiting thrombin (34) and platelet activating factor (35). When given orally to mice, andrographis extract was shown to neutralize snake venom (9). In addition, andrographolides inhibit HIV-induced dysregulation of cell cycle and increased CD4+ lymphocyte levels in HIV-1 patients (10). Andrographolides also demonstrate anticancer effects in preclinical studies. Activity against multiple myeloma cells may occur via TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway inhibition (52). In human colorectal cancer cells, reversal of 5-FU resistance was attributed to elevated BAX expression (50). In addition, migration and invasion was inhibited through suppression of mRNA and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 protein levels (13), while MMP-2 activity was also identified (14). Inhibition of IL-6 expression and IL-6-mediated signals occurs in human prostate cancer cells (12). In non-small cell lung cancer cells andrographolides reduced invasiveness by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway and inhibiting MMP-7 expression (15). Apoptosis in human hepatoma cells occurred via c-Jun N-terminal kinase induction (16) and caspase activation (17). Decreased adhesion of gastric cancer cells to endothelial tissue was attributed to inhibition of E-selection expression (18). Inhibition of tumor cell growth may also occur by stimulating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte production via IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion (19). Andrographolides also enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell death in several human cancer cell lines, mainly through JAK-STAT suppression (20).',\n",

The rhizome is used as a spice in regional cuisines, and as a coloring agent in food and cosmetics for its yellow-orange color. It is also used in traditional medicine for improving circulation and digestion. Turmeric extracts are marketed as dietary supplements to improve memory, for arthritis, and for cancer prevention. The active constituents are turmerone oil and water-soluble curcuminoids, among which curcumin has been the focus of research. In vitro studies suggest that curcumin acts as a weak phytoestrogen (1), and exhibits neuroprotective (2), choleretic (3), anti-inflammatory (4), immunomodulatory (5), anti-proliferative (3), and chemopreventive effects (6) (7) (8). Curcumin, its analogs, and liposomal formulations have also produced chemosensitizing (9) (10) (11) and radiosensitizing effects (12) (13). Turmeric and its active constituents have been investigated for their therapeutic activities in humans. A clinical trial suggests it may be effective against major depressive disorder (62). Data from an epidemiological study suggest improved cognitive performance in elderly Asians who consume turmeric in the form of curry powder (14); however, there were no benefits from curcumin supplementation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (15). Turmeric may help alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (16) or quiescent ulcerative colitis (17), but in a double-blind randomized trial of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, there was no reduction in lower intestinal tract adenomas with long-term use of curcumin versus placebo (70). Turmeric extract was found to be safe and equally effective as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (18). Whether curcumin supplementation increases cholesterol levels is unclear, as study results are mixed (19) (20). In a study of postmenopausal women, consumption of curcumin along with aerobic exercise training were shown to improve vascular endothelial function (61). Findings of a systematic review suggest that turmeric or curcumin supplementation may benefit patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease by positively affecting serum concentrations of liver enzymes (75). Turmeric has also been studied in cancer patients. Oral curcumin administered to colorectal cancer patients during the pre-surgery waiting period improved cachexia and the general health of patients (21). In a phase II trial of oral curcumin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, no treatment-related toxic effects were observed, and clinically relevant biological activity was seen in two patients despite limited absorption (22). Other preliminary results suggest turmeric during capecitabine treatment may reduce rates of hand-foot syndrome (71). In another study, supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin resulted in a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment (65). In early phase studies, a combination of curcumin and docetaxel was shown to be safe (23). Curcumin with gemcitabine was also found to be safe and feasible for further study (24) (25), but a high dose of curcumin must be used to achieve systemic effect (23) (25). A dose-finding trial of a curcumin extract to determine safety and efficacy for patients with metastatic disease undergoing standard FOLFOX chemotherapy is currently underway (72). Preliminary data suggest effectiveness of a topical turmeric-based cream for reduction of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer (64); and of topical application of turmeric or curcumin for controlling signs and symptoms of oral mucositis (76). Curcumin is known to interfere with cytochrome P450 enzymes (26) (27) and may interact with chemotherapy drugs like cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (28). Overall, the development of turmeric for clinical use needs further investigation due to its inherent poor absorption, rapid metabolism, complex mechanistic profile, and largely preclinical data.',\n",

It is the most studied of all I3C metabolites and is thought to be superior to IC3 as a chemoprotective compound for breast cancer and prostate cancer (3). DIM demonstrated anti-inflammatory (16) (17), antiproliferative (16) and chemopreventive (18) effects in vitro and in animal models. It was also shown to increase bone mass (19), which may have implications for patients with osteoporosis.

But DIM supplementation did not exert any positive effects in women with cervical cell abnormalities (13) although conflicting evidence indicates that it may help reverse cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (21). Additional studies are needed. A pilot study showed that daily DIM leads to changes in estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women with a history of early stage breast cancer (4). In a RCT of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen, daily DIM promoted an increase in the metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) (anti-tumorigenic) to 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1) (pro-tumorigenic) (25).

A crude extract of isatis root prevented influenza virus attachment to cells and therefore viral replication, but was inactive against respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus and enterovirus (19). Another component of isatis root demonstrates dose-dependent anti-endotoxic effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of membrane-organizing extension spike protein, a main endotoxin receptor (10). Alkaloids isolated from isatis can inhibit leukocyte function and reduce inflammatory response (20).

The hepatoprotective effects of lycium polysaccharide (LBP) are in part via modulation of transcription factor NF-κB and MAPK pathways and autophagy (6). In another study, LBP was shown to act as a novel antioxidant against insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, (PI3K/AKT/Nrf2) pathway (24). It also exerts protective effects against focal cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (25). In murine models of cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis LBP reduced inflammation by upregulating NRF2 and HO-1 (30); and had protective effects on diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which is thought to be mediated via the induction of autophagy (31). In addition, LBP was shown to inhibit the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells (2), and increase expression of interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (3). The antiproliferative effects of LBP are via activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) (20). It was also shown to induce systemic and local immune responses in H22 tumor-bearing mice via alleviating immunosuppression and by maintaining antitumor immune responses (32).',\n",

Bitter almonds containing amygdalin are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to remove “blood stasis” and to treat abscesses (1). Amygdalin was first used to treat cancer more than a century ago in Russia and later in the United States. A purified form sold as Laetrile has been a popular alternative cancer therapy since the 1960s. Some claimed amygdalin to be a vitamin (B17) and that deficiencies could cause cancer, but this is not substantiated by scientific evidence (2). Amygdalin is banned in the United States but it is available in other countries and online. Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase into benzaldehyde, glucose and cyanide in the intestine (3) (4). Cyanide is believed to be cytotoxic with actions selective against cancerous cells, but results from animal studies were mostly negative (4) (5) (6). Other preclinical data suggest that amygdalin has hepatoprotective effects (39); may help relieve pain due to its anti-inflammatory (7) and analgesic properties (8); and exerts protective effects by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transitions following chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (35). Amygdalin also inhibited tumor growth, but further studies are needed to confirm this finding (9). A clinical trial in the late 1970s supported by the National Cancer Institute did not find amygdalin beneficial, and some patients in the study developed cyanide toxicity (10). A systematic review also concluded that amygdalin is ineffective against cancer (11). With the recent discovery of anticancer properties of amygdalin through previously unknown mechanisms (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (32) (36) (37), there is renewed interest in whether this agent may have potential as an anticancer treatment.

In humans, transfer factors appear to be well tolerated and have shown some efficacy in the treatment of herpes (2), acute infection in children (3), chronic fatigue syndrome (4), and Candidiasis (5). One study showed effectiveness in increasing white blood cells, CD8 lymphocytes and interleukin 2 levels among patients with HIV (6).

Acqueous extracts of cat’s claw were shown to enhance DNA repair after chemical-induced damage (22). Protection against oxidative DNA damage following UVB exposure may occur via enhanced base excision repair and inherent antioxidant effects (23).

       " 'Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin derived from plant. Natural food sources include plant oils, wheat germ, eggs, green leafy vegetables, and whole grains (3). Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant and is thought to help prevent and treat many diseases. Although available in a variety of formulations, only the d-isomer is considered active (1). Studies evaluating vitamin E supplementation suggest that it may improve immune response in the elderly. Vitamin E may slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (9) (15) (16) (18); however, conflicting data from another study do not support the utility of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, lipoid acid, and Coenzyme Q) (43). It was also ineffective in arresting the development or progression of macular degeneration (14) and Early Parkinson’s Disease (21). Vitamin E did not decrease the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections (12), reduce mortality, or reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or cerebrovascular accident (26). When taken along with vitamin C, vitamin E may increase mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (13). Further, findings from the recent Physicians’ Health Study II show that neither vitamin E nor C is beneficial in preventing cardiovascular events; vitamin E may actually increase the risk of stroke (36). The Women’s Health Study also failed to find any benefit of vitamin E supplementation in lowering the risk of heart failure in healthy women (42). A meta-analysis showed that vitamin E increases the risk for hemorrhagic stroke but reduces the risk of ischemic stroke (38). Vitamin E can reduce signs and symptoms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults (45), but not in children and adolescents (46) . Vitamin E was shown to reduce the risk of some cancers (19) (20). It may help to relieve hot flashes in breast cancer survivors (27), and to reduce the incidence of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity (22). However, data suggest that supplementation with vitamins C, E, and beta carotene is not beneficial in preventing cancer incidence or affecting cancer mortality (37). Furthermore, vitamin E when used alone or with other supplements did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer (28). A large scale clinical Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) evaluated the role of vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention. Initial review shows that vitamin E taken alone or with selenium for 5 years did not reduce the risk of prostate cancer (35); observational data from 7 years of participant follow-up indicate a significant increase in the risk of prostate cancer with vitamin E supplementation (41). Vitamin E, when used together with soy and selenium, did not prevent prostate cancer progression (40). Further, findings from other studies indicate vitamin E may actually increase risk of lung cancer (33) and overall mortality (28). At the same time, conflicting data suggest an association between dietary tocopherol and a reduction in risk of lung cancer (38) (48).

In a randomized open-label study, intravenous vinpocetine adjunctive to treatment for acute cerebral infarction improved cerebral blood flow, neurological functioning, and cognition (29). Vinpocetine inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (15). In animal studies, it potentiates the effects of radiation therapy in tumor cells (16). However, vinpocetine has not yet been studied in humans for its potential anticancer effects.

The fruit juice extracted from the arils of the seeds is used in drinks and as a dietary supplement. Several studies have shown that pomegranate has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties which are attributed to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid (1) (2). Consumption of pomegranate juice was found to benefit patients with carotid artery stenosis (6), hypertension (7), hyperlipidemia (21), or mild to moderate erectile dysfunction (19), as well as patients with coronary heart disease (8), but had no effect in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (9). A systematic review determined the evidence on pomegranate supplementation for blood pressure management is limited (34). In a study of postmenopausal women, intake of pomegranate seed oil did not reduce hot flashes (22). In preclinical studies, pomegranate juice suppressed inflammatory cell signaling (1), inhibited prostate tumor growth, and lowered serum PSA levels (3) (4). It also inhibited aromatase activity, endogenous estrogen biosynthesis, and breast cancer cell proliferation (5). A pomegranate seed extract alleviated ciplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in animal studies (23). In prostate cancer patients, the safety and utility of pomegranate has been studied neoadjuvantly, during active surveillance or with biochemical recurrence, and in those with advanced cancer. Pomegranate extract before surgery resulted in pomegranate metabolite accumulation in prostate tissue, but did not significantly lower 8-OHdG levels, a measure of oxidative damage (35). Although pomegranate juice slowed the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase in men with high PSA levels, data are conflicting (2) (24). A planned subset analysis suggests that those with the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) AA genotype might benefit (36). Supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin resulted in lower rates of PSA increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment (25). An adjunctive intervention with pomegranate juice in men with advanced prostate cancer did not produce significant PSA reductions versus placebo (37). Recent investigations suggest pomegranate extract can modulate gene expression for both osteoclastic and osteogenic processes in postmenopausal women, suggesting a possible role in bone health (26), but there was no overall association between pomegranate juice intake and hormonal biomarkers for breast cancer risk (38). Pomegranate extract influenced changes in gene expression in colon tissues from colorectal patients (27). In newly-diagnosed CRC patients, pomegranate consumption may lower plasma LPS-binding protein levels, a marker for endotoxemia (33). More studies are needed to determine the implications of such changes. Although animal studies suggested pomegranate may inhibit cytochrome P450 3A and 2C9 (10) (11) (18), humans studies have not shown clinically relevant interactions (12) (39) (40) (41).',\n",

Although it has been postulated that DHEA may play a role in increasing immune response in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (7), no antiviral or immunostimulatory effects were observed in HIV-positive participants receiving DHEA (8). In clinical trials, DHEA was shown effective in treating Addison’s disease (13) (14) (15) (16) (17), major depression (9), schizophrenia-induced anxiety (10), systematic lupus erythematosus (11), osteoporosis (12), and erectile dysfunction (13). Topical application of DHEA in postmenopausal women resulted in increased sebum production and epidermal thickening in the hands and face (18). However, other studies did not find effectivess of DHEA in treating Alzheimer’s disease (19), obesity in adolescents (20), or perimenopausal symptoms (21). Furthermore, DHEA does not increase muscle mass (22) or physical performance (23), enhance insulin secretion or action (24), or improve cognitive performance (25) in elderly individuals. DHEA supplementation, believed to enhance physical strength, did not improve physical performance or quality of life in a study done in older men and women (26).

In animal models, echinacea stimulated erythropoiesis, increased blood-oxygen transport (29) (30), produced anxiolytic effects (31), and exhibited wound-healing properties (32) (33) (34). Clinical data indicate that echinacea is ineffective in preventing the common cold caused by rhinoviruses (4) or in treating upper respiratory infections (5) (6) (16). Studies of its ability to reduce incidence and duration of the common cold yielded mixed results (7) (8) (9) (10) (22) (35) (36). Other analyses do not indicate any benefits for treating colds, and weak evidence for a prophylactic benefit (26) (37), but a large randomized trial found an echinacea formulation to be as effective as oseltamivir for influenza, and with fewer adverse events in the echinacea group (38). Small studies have shown that a standardized echinacea root extract has immunomodulating activity (39); and an echinacea/sage spray was useful in treating acute sore throats (17). Preliminary data on improving or enhancing athletic performance are mixed (40) (41). But a topical echinacea extract was reported effective in alleviating symptoms associated with atopic eczema (63). Echinacea may also have anticancer potential evidenced by the cytotoxic effects exerted by an extract and a major compound, cichoric acid, in human colon cancer cells (42). Some studies suggest that echinacea could decrease plasma levels, affect therapeutic efficacy, or cause adverse effects with some anticancer drugs (25) (43). In HIV-infected patients, co-administration with etravirine was found to be safe and well tolerated (44). In a large population-based study, use of echinacea was associated with a slight increase in diastolic blood pressure (45). There is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of echinacea during pregnancy (46).',\n",

Changes in omega-3 fatty acid blood levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease and depression (27). The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids likely are due its ability to be incorporated into and thereby enhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques (26). Increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to increase lipid peroxidation. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, therefore, may increase oxidative stress on the body. Studies have shown that mucosal alpha-tocopherol levels decrease upon omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, which researchers believe may result from the body’s attempt to counteract the added oxidative burden (11). Besides reducing serum antioxidant levels, little is known about how this added oxidative stress affects the body. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to decrease IL-6 (18) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (28) levels while leaving most other mononuclear cell functions unaffected (29). Omega-3 fatty acids may also reduce inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis by reducing rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 (10). Because of their anti-inflammatory effects, omega-3 fatty acids were thought to benefit patients with asthma (22) and cystic fibrosis (21), but data are inconclusive. Increasing PUFA intake in pregnant women increases PUFA concentration but not cytokine concentration in human milk (30).

       " 'Carnitine is a nutrient that plays an important role in fatty acid absorption and mitochondria function. It can be found in diets that include meat, or synthesized endogenously from lysine and methionine. Deficiencies can be caused by genetic disorders, malnutrition, malabsorption, and kidney dialysis. These can affect the heart, skeletal muscles, liver, nerve, and endocrine functions. Carnitine is marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance physical performance and to treat fatigue, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, liver disorders, and cancer. Animal models suggest that L-carnitine has cardioprotective (8) (14) and antioxidant effects (31). It may help prevent cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients (24). Long-term carnitine supplementation in humans is correlated with improved myocardial mechanical performance, reduction in ventricular arrhythmias, and increased exercise tolerance (7). However, L-carnitine administration did not improve risk of death or heart failure in patients with anterior acute myocardial infarction (36). Preliminary results suggest L-carnitine may improve symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (22) and physical performance in patients undergoing dialysis for end-stage renal disease (9), but data of its benefits in alleviating fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis are inconclusive (21). Several trials have shown enhanced physical performance (17) (20), and improved aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance (32). Other studies show mixed results (37) (38) (39) and its clinical value and safety needs additional study. L-carnitine used by itself or in combination with clomiphene citrate may help in the treatment against idiopathic male infertility (25), although it did not improve sperm count or motility (40). Oral carnitine supplementation may improve mental health parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (2). There are studies looking into the effects of carnitine in cancer patients. L-carnitine supplementation improved nutritional status and quality of life in pancreatic cancer patients (27). Other preliminary data show that L-carnitine by itself (15) (23) or in combination with Coenzyme Q10 (33) may relieve chemotherapy-related fatigue. L-carnitine also demonstrated benefits against fatigue both in younger hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine and thyroid cancer patients who have hypothyroidism post-surgery (41). However, carnitine does not improve fatigue in patients with invasive malignancies (28). Carnitine may inhibit cisplatin-induced injury of the kidney and small intestine (13). Additional studies are needed to determine the cancer populations in which carnitine supplementation may be most beneficial. An ester derivative, acetyl-L-carnitine, is also available as a dietary supplement and is often used as a neuroprotective agent. It may help to reduce diabetic neuropathy (42) (43) or improve cognition in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy (44). In elderly patients with dysthymic disorder, it was found to be comparable with fluoxetine (45); however, other studies did not find it effective for Alzheimer’s disease (46) (47). One study actually showed that acetyl-L-carnitine can increase chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) (35). Therefore, patients receiving chemotherapy should avoid this product.',\n",

While metabolic changes such as increased aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis occur in cancerous cells, (8) the role of O3FAs in the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer is still under investigation (2). The polyunsaturated O3FAs in flaxseed oil have been shown to decrease levels of proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and Interleukin-1 beta (9). O3FAs also demonstrated antineoplastic properties by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species and decreasing protumorigenic prostaglandins (2). Flax oil supplements increased total phospholipid fatty acid content in erythrocytes (10), but the implication of this finding in cancer treatment is unknown. Flaxseed supplements also inhibit proliferation of human prostate cancer (11) and inhibit breast cancer growth in vitro by downregulating growth factors and increasing p53 expression (12). Furthermore, whole flaxseed contains lignans, phytoestrogens which may also have antineoplastic properties and exert hormonal effects (13). Budwig believed that combining cottage cheese and flaxseed oil allowed for better availability of essential fatty acids through the plasma membrane, allowing for improved aerobic cellular respiration (1). The effect of cottage cheese consumption on the bioavailability of O3FAs has not been studied. Processed fats, saturated fats, animal fats, processed foods, and sugar are prohibited in the Budwig diet because they are thought to interfere with oxygen uptake and cellular respiration. Epidemiological studies show that people who consume lacto-vegetarian diets have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer compared with non-vegetarians (14) (15), although these studies indicate association rather than causation. An animal study showed that greater tumor regression occurred in mice treated with trastuzumab therapy plus flax oil compared with those treated with trastuzumab alone (16).',\n",

       " 'Chlorogenic acid, isoorientin, and swertiajaponin were identified as the active constituents in lemongrass that possess antioxidant properties to prevent endothelial dysfunction via a nitric oxide-independent vasodilatador effect on blood vessels (46). In vitro, anti-inflammatory effects of lemongrass occur through inhibition of IL-1beta (26), and proteasome and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways by chlorogenic acid (47). In rat cerebellar granule neuron cultures, neuroprotective effects were attributed to antiapoptotic activity that occurred with cell cycle arrest in the G0G1 phase (27). In animal models, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects were attributed to the major constituents citral and geranial (33). The anti-inflammatory effects of citral were further attributed to PPAR-gamma activation (38). Lemongrass inhibits release of the inflammation marker myeloperoxidase from neutrophils and suppresses IL-6 and IL-1alpha production in mice peritoneal macrophages (13). A lemongrass hexane extract modulated allergic asthma via inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B activation (34). Analgesic effects by the constituent citronellol are attributed to inhibition of peripheral mediators as well as central inhibitory mechanisms (22). Anxiolytic activity of lemongrass appeared to be mediated by the GABAergic system (35). It also altered onset and duration of convulsions and potentiated sleep time through GABAergic mechanisms (3), and increased seizure threshold by blocking seizure propagation (15). In humans, the erythropoiesis-boosting effects produced with lemongrass tea consumption are likely due to its nutritional constituents and antioxidant and pharmacologic properties (43). As aromatherapy to revert reactive anxiety, lemongrass essential oil appears to act through the olfactory or nose-to-brain pathways to restore homeostasis (45). Several constituents in lemongrass demonstrate anticancer activity. Isointermedeol upregulates tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 leading to apoptosis through the extrinsic Fas pathway (2) (11). It also increases mitochondrial expression and activation of caspase-9 via the intrinsic cell death pathway. Citral induced apoptosis via caspase-3 enzymatic activity in human leukemia and breast cancer cells (8), and induced glutathione S-transferase (GST) through an electrophilic interaction with glutathione in rat liver epithelial cells. GST functions in cell detoxification by rescuing cells from oxidative damage and carcinogenic compounds (9) (12). Cytotoxicity was attributed to the presence of an unsaturated aldehyde group, which is specific to the geranial isomer of citral (9). Polysaccharides from lemongrass produced cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in cervical and prostate carcinoma cells via caspase 3 upregulation and Bcl-2 downregulation followed by cytochrome c release (29), and antitumor and immunomodulatory activities in sarcoma-180 tumor cells were attributed to immunoenhancement rather than direct cytotoxicity (31).',\n",

       " 'Vinpocetine is a synthetic ethyl ester of apovincamine derived from an alkaloid in the common periwinkle plant (17). In vitro, antioxidant and hydroxyl radical scavenging properties have been observed (18) (13). Vinpocetine inhibits phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) activity and improves cerebral blood flow by elevating cGMP and cAMP, increasing mitochondrial function, and improving glucose and oxygen utilization by the brain. Vinpocetine helps improve spatial memory in rats by preventing neuronal damage and favorably modulating cholinergic function (18). Antiepileptic effects were attributed to suppression of abnormal neuronal excitability via sodium channel regulation and dopamine release in striatal nerve endings (5) (6) (7). Vinpocetine antagonizes platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced extracellular matrix synthesis, suppresses intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) production, and inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth (4). Anti-atherogenic effects occur through inhibition of monocyte adhesion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses mediated by protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ĸB)-dependent pathways (3). Vinpocetine also demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB activities (19) as well as Akt and STAT3 activation (15). In a murine model of otitis media, vinpocetine suppressed S. pneumoniae-induced mucus production through mucin MUC5AC inhibition (27). Administration of vinpocetine to chronic stroke patients increased glucose uptake and release in unaffected areas of the brain (12). In vitro and in vivo studies indicate vinpocetine antitumor activity against human breast cancer cells occurs through G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis (15). Vinpocetine can also increase the effects of radiation by increasing tumor oxygenation (16).',\n",

A few studies have explored its antihypertensive and amyloid-plaque degrading abilities (1) (2) (3) (4) (5). Nattokinase decreases platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in a dose-dependent fashion both in vitro and in vivo (6) (7). Reduced intimal thickening was observed in the femoral artery of rats that were fed a diet containing nattō (8). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, nattokinase capsules reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure in pre-hypertensive patients (3). The observation that nattokinase degrades amyloid plaques (1) (9) led to an interest in exploring it as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which is characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques. Nattokinase has also been promoted as an alternative anticancer treatment based on the notion that it can help dissolve the fibrin coating around a tumor, and increase oxygen supply in the blood to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, these mechanisms have not been proven in humans. Theoretically, nattokinase may increase bleeding risk when used with anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic drugs.

In vitro, both methanolic and aqueous extracts of maca exhibit estrogenic activity (10). A methanol maca extract demonstrated antiviral activity against Flu-A and Flu-B viruses (17). An isolated N‑alkylamide from maca root was found to possess both direct and indirect cannabimimetic actions (32). Maca polysaccharides demonstrated radical scavenging activity (18). Macamides, normally not present in fresh plants but introduced during traditional drying practices (31), are fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors, and act on the central nervous system by modulating the release of neurotransmitters (19). Antidepressant-like effects were associated with activation of both noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems and attenuation of oxidative stress (20). In animal models, maca powder derived from tubers enhanced serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in female rats during the proestrus LH surge in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting it may enhance fertility (33). In postmenopausal models, maca modulates hormone levels particularly by decreasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (21). In humans, although maca does not affect serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone, or estradiol in men (4) (9), it appears to modulate some hormone levels in women in some studies (24) (26) but not others (25) (27). Increased LH and decreased FSH that corresponded with improved sexual functioning in postmenopausal women are potentially attributed to a negative feedback loop, resulting in increased androgen production (24) (26). It may also exert androgenic effects at the testosterone receptor on target organs without affecting testosterone or gonadotrophin levels (24) (30). At the same time, the benefits of maca for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women may be more a function of advancing age rather than menopausal status, as there was no correlation with estrogen levels (24).',\n",

Ribose and deoxyribose are aldopentoses, monosaccharides containing five carbon atoms. Both are reducing sugars; in basic solution, they form an aldehyde or ketone, which function as reducing agents, thereby oxidizing the other chemical species. Ribose phosphates are components of nucleotide coenzymes and are utilized by microorganisms in the synthesis of the amino acid histidine, one of the 22 amino acids commonly found in animal proteins. Ribose is the sugar that begins the metabolic process for production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the major source of energy used by cells, including muscle tissue, for normal function. Ribose primarily occurs as D-ribose; its enantiomer L-ribose does not exist in nature and is touted as a rare and expensive monosaccharide.',\n",

       " 'Zinc is an essential element necessary for human physiologic functions including enzymatic reactions, bone formation, and regulation of synaptic signaling. It is thought to have antioxidant and immunostimulant activities and is used as a dietary supplement to treat the common cold, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, warts, and male infertility. Zinc deficiency is relatively rare in the United States, and more common among developing countries, patients with various health conditions, and some who habitually consume vegetarian diets (1) (2). Zinc sulfate is the most studied supplement, but it is also sold in other forms such as gluconate for better absorption. It is also an ingredient in some over-the-counter products such as cold remedies, topical creams, and denture adhesives. Zinc may reduce rhinoviral infection and replication. Short-term use of zinc lozenges reduces symptoms associated with the common cold but results are inconsistent (3) (4) (5). Data analysis of 18 clinical trials suggests that in otherwise healthy individuals, zinc supplementation reduces duration but not severity of cold symptoms when administered within 24 hours of onset (6). Intranasal zinc products used to treat colds have been removed from the market due to adverse events, and were found to damage human nasal tissue (7) (8). Zinc supplementation may reduce acute upper respiratory infections or diarrhea among infants (70). However, study results among children with cystic fibrosis are mixed (9) (71), and a Cochrane review cites a lack of corresponding reduction in required intravenous antibiotics (10). Zinc supplementation also had a negative treatment effect in severe pediatric bacterial pneumonias, causing significantly longer hospital stays and slower recovery (11). In nursing home elderly, zinc supplementation increased serum zinc concentrations and was associated with enhanced T-cell function (72). However, zinc was not found to be an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and serum zinc concentrations can actually be higher in patients with RA than healthy individuals (12) (13) (14). Studies have found that zinc supplementation can reduce markers of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in children (15) (16) and reduce the severity of diarrhea (17) (18) (19). It also may be effective for the treatment of tinnitus but not in the elderly (20) (21). Both oral and topical zinc show efficacy in treating warts (22) (23) (24), but there does not appear to be an advantage with topical zinc over mainstream treatments (25). Zinc deficiency has been linked to various chronic ailments (26), infertility (27) (28), and increased mortality (29). Animal models and human studies have also linked zinc deficiency to an increased risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (30) while both deficiency and excess zinc intake (more than 100 mg/day) have been linked to prostate cancer (31) (32) (33) (34) (35). However, zinc >15 mg/day for 10 years was found to decrease risk of advanced prostate cancer (36). At the same time, epidemiological studies have illustrated a relationship between high zinc levels in breast tissue and breast cancer (37). Taken together, the research suggests that optimal zinc intake plays a role in achieving protective effects. Zinc may help control some cancer treatment symptoms, but evidence is mixed. Zinc supplementation may benefit oral cancer patients receiving radiation to prevent mucositis (38), but another study in head and neck cancer patients found no significant benefit (39), and there are conflicting results regarding its efficacy for taste preservation (40) (41) (42). Zinc supplementation also does not prolong survival in this population (43), but may improve overall survival in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (44). Zinc supplementation may help reduce infection episodes in children with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy (69). In two small studies of colorectal cancer patients, zinc supplementation during chemotherapy prevented fatigue (73), increased superoxide dismutase activity, and maintained vitamin E concentrations (74). Further research is needed to confirm these findings.',\n",

       " 'Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) is an alternative cancer therapy that uses insulin to potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and other medications. This therapy was developed in Mexico by Dr. Donato Perez Garcia in the 1930s and has been used together with other unconventional therapies for many years (1). Advocates of IPT believe that cancer cells consume more sugar than healthy cells and are therefore more sensitive to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) (2) (7). Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, increasing the intracellular concentration and cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs (1). According to the theory underlying this therapy, if cancer cells can be activated by exogenous insulin, a reduced dose (up to one-tenth the normal dose) of a chemotherapy drug can provide the same cytotoxic effects with less severe adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic profiles on concurrent use of insulin and chemotherapy drugs are lacking and it is unclear whether insulin also potentiates toxic effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells. Exploratory studies suggest some benefit with a combination of chemotherapy and IPT (9) (10), but well-designed clinical trials have not been conducted. Many of the medications used in IPT, such as insulin and other chemotherapy drugs, are FDA-approved but IPT clinics administer them “off-label.” Furthermore, some clinics that administer IPT are not operated or staffed by oncologists. Side effects of IPT include hypoglycemic reaction. A systematic review of 21 studies showed a correlation between circulating levels of IGF-I, IGFBP3 (IGF-binding protein) and an increased risk of common cancers (8).',\n",
       " 'Chromium is an essential trace element involved with glucose and lipid metabolism, circulating insulin levels, and the peripheral activity of insulin (1). In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that chromium potentiates the activity of insulin (23) (42). This is thought to occur via enhanced intracellular tyrosine kinase activity that results from an interaction between chromium, low molecular weight chromium-binding substance, and activated cell surface insulin receptors (2). In animal models of diabetes, chromium recovered beta cell functioning and alleviated macroangiopathy (27). It also augmented the insulin signaling pathway, dulled negative-regulators of insulin signaling, enhanced adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity to increase cellular glucose uptake, and attenuated oxidative stress (42). Chromium may also modulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) proteins (28). Antidepressant effects occur via modified brain 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT) function and increased serotonergic and noradrenergic functioning (30) (31). Additional mechanisms for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects include the lowering of plasma corticosterone levels via reversal of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) axis overactivity (32). In humans, suggested antidepressant mechanisms include 5HT2A downregulation and increased insulin sensitivity (38).',\n",

Lemongrass is widely used as a flavoring agent in Asian cuisine, in perfumery, and as an insect repellent (6). It has been used in folk medicine as a sedative (3), to reduce gastrointestinal problems (4), and for its central nervous system-depressant effects (5). It is traditionally consumed as a tea and used in aromatherapy. In vitro, lemongrass exhibits antimicrobial (21) (23) (24), antibiofilm (25), anti-inflammatory (26), neuroprotective (27), vasorelaxant (10), and antidiabetic effects (28). Lemongrass extracts and constituents have shown antioxidant, antiproliferative, and apoptotic activity (8) (9) (29) (30). Animal models also suggest anticancer (31), anti-inflammatory (32), anti-allergic (33) (34), and anxyolitic activity (35), as well as protective effects on various organ systems (36) (37) (38) (39) (40). In human pilot studies, lemongrass essential oil formulations were a helpful adjunct to periodontal therapy for patients with chronic periodontitis (41) and helped reduce oral thrush in HIV-positive patients (7). Lemongrass demonstrated antifungal activity against pityriasis versicolor, but was not as effective as ketoconazole (42). In other studies evaluating lemongrass tea consumption, erythropoiesis-boosting effects were observed, suggesting possible uses in the treatment or prevention of anemia (43). However, lemongrass tea may also produce dose- and time-dependent adverse effects on renal function (44). Other studies have not found lemongrass tea ingestion to reduce anxiety or to benefit sleep (5). However, brief inhalation of lemongrass essential oil may help to accelerate recovery from some types of anxiety compared with controls (45). More studies are needed to confirm this effect. Although lemongrass and its constituents induced apoptosis in some cancer cell lines (11) (12) (29) (30) (31), they have not been studied in cancer patients.',\n",

In vitro, ginkgo extracts exhibit chemopreventive (1), anticancer (2), and cytotoxic (3) effects. Although marketed for memory improvement, clinical studies including the large Gingko Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study generally show supplementation with ginkgo does not improve cognitive performance or prevent Alzheimer’s disease or dementia (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . In addition, positive effects from earlier studies were not confirmed in more recent trials and some systematic reviews determined there was insufficient evidence on any benefits in adults with either normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (9) (10). Although two trials suggest potential benefit with gingko in patients who had an acute ischemic stroke (11) (12), a study in older adults noted increased stroke incidence in the ginkgo group versus placebo (4). In addition, the large GEM study did not find benefit with ginkgo for cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality (13). Several studies indicate that ginkgo is not beneficial for tinnitus (14) (15). Studies on using ginkgo for ADHD in children (16) (17) and for mountain sickness (18) (19) yielded mixed results.

Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. (See Cayenne Pepper) Studies support benefits of topical low-concentration capsaicin formulations for psoriasis (1), prurigo nodularis (2), and pruritus ani (3). Although topical capsaicin has been included among conditional recommendations for osteoarthritis (4), its utility for rheumatoid arthritis remains inconclusive (5). An older clinical trial shows capsaicin 0.075% cream may control post-surgical pain in cancer patients (6). A case report in a palliative care patient using capsaicin 0.025% for opioid-refractory upper extremity pain also reported benefit (7). A high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch was shown safe and effective for postherpetic neuralgia (8), and was approved for prescription use. Data also show its effectiveness in controlling diabetic peripheral neuropathy (36), and providing sustained relief from heterogenous neuropathic pain (37) and neuropathic pain arising from radiculopathies (38). However, a subsequent application for HIV-associated neuropathic pain was rejected (9). A recent systematic review cites some benefit for both postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy over controls. However, the patch is best used when other therapies have failed due to the small number of patients who may benefit (1 in 8) and unknown risks (10). Low-concentration capsaicin was determined as unlikely to have meaningful use for these conditions in clinical practice (11). Data are also limited in patients with post-mastectomy neuropathy (12). A preliminary study suggests improved swallowing function in elderly patients with dysphagia when 0.025% capsaicin ointment was applied to the external auditory canal (43). In other reports, several case series suggest topical capsaicin can be effective for cannabis-associated hyperemesis (39) (42). Only a few small studies suggest intranasal capsaicin of divergent formulations may be helpful for rhinitis (13) (14), and its effectiveness for cluster headaches is unknown (15). There is continued controversy over whether capsaicin acts as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen (16) (17) (18). For example, capsaicin has demonstrated chemopreventive and antiproliferative effects against various cell lines including breast (19), bladder (20), prostate cancer cells (21).

       " 'Boswellia serrata is a tree prevalent in India, the Middle East and North Africa. The gummy exudate or resin obtained by peeling away the bark is commonly known as frankincense or olibanum. Boswellia, also referred to as Indian frankincense, is used widely in Ayurveda for treating arthritis, ulcerative colitis, coughs, sores, wound healing, and asthma. It is marketed as a supplement to support and improve joint health and mobility. The major component is boswellic acid (1), a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects (1) (2) (3). It also demonstrated cytotoxic (4) (5) (6) (7) and radio-enhancing properties (21), and prevented intestinal tumorigenesis in a murine model (26). Other animal studies suggest boswellia may improve cognitive impairment and insulin resistance (42). Essential oil of boswellia has been shown to have antimicrobial activities (24). Preliminary data suggest benefit with boswellia for bronchial asthma (8), ulcerative colitis (9), mild irritable bowel syndrome (38), and osteo-muscular pain (36). However, these trials are mostly small and nonrandomized. In addition, current evidence is mostly unclear or negative on any benefits for collagenous colitis (12) (13) (14), and demonstrated no significant benefit in maintaining Crohn’s disease remission (15). In osteoarthritis, one trial using an enriched boswellic acid extract suggests benefit (11), and other studies report efficacy with formulations containing boswellia, Terminalia chebula, turmeric (39), and boswellic acid along with curcumin (40). However, larger well-designed studies are needed for clinical recommendation (41). Other preliminary data suggest boswellia may be effective in reducing cerebral edema in patients with brain tumors following radiotherapy (23). A boswellia-based cream was found useful in preventing skin damage due to radiotherapy in breast cancer patients (32). Other data suggest that a combination of boswellic acid, betaine, and myo-inositol treatment may help to reduce mammary density, a risk factor for breast cancer (33). Although similar in many functions, boswellia should not be confused with guggul or myrrh.',\n",

       " 'Folate is an essential member of the vitamin B complex family that is naturally present in grains, green leafy vegetables, and liver. Folic acid and the L-methylfolate (5-MTHF) derivative are synthetic supplemental forms that have higher bioavailability (1). Folate is important in cell growth and division and involved in the methylation process and DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake can cause deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia. Folate is essential during pregnancy, with supplementation shown to reduce risks of neural tube birth defects (10) and medulloblastoma in offspring (11). A study among South American populations suggests the protective effect against neural tube defects may be greater in female than male infants (65). In high doses (5 mg/day), it reduced homocysteine levels at time of delivery and may lessen pregnancy complications (43). Supplementation may also benefit women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (42), and high folate intake reduced chromosomal aberrations in sperm of healthy men (12). But supplements taken beyond the first trimester did not prevent pre-eclampsia in women at high risk for this disorder (72). In other studies, folic acid decreased homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality (13) (14) (15), along with lowering blood pressure in smokers (5) (16). Among hypertensive adults, folic acid therapy reduced risk of first stroke (44) (45) (66), but smoking status may affect efficacy (67). Other trials on stroke risk have yielded mixed results (17) (18) (19) (20), with a meta analysis indicating moderate to low evidence for preventive benefits of folic acid for total cardiovascular disease; and folic acid and B-vitamins for stroke (73). Folic acid supplementation has been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults (26). In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, it improved response to cholinesterase inhibitors (27), cognition, and inflammatory markers (46). In individuals chronically exposed to arsenic, it lowered blood arsenic concentrations by facilitating urinary excretion (28). There is limited evidence on whether supplementation can increase serum folate levels, or has an effect on anemia in patients with sickle cell disease (68). But a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements decreased serum homocysteine levels and improved anemia in patients with multiple sclerosis (74); and folic acid added to antipsychotics may improve symptoms in schizophrenic patients (75). Studies on increased folate intake or supplements to reduce cancer risk are mixed. In young children, folic acid fortification was associated with reduced incidence of Wilms tumor and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) (36). Folate supplementation also helps cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) regression (47). Low levels of folate in the blood are associated with certain forms of cancer (9), whereas higher levels of dietary folate have been shown to reduce the risk of breast (2) and pancreatic cancers (3), but not prostate cancer (7). Studies on colorectal cancer risk produced mixed results (4) (5) (32) (35) (48) and some even suggest a negative effect (6) (8) (49) (71). A large population study suggested an association between dietary folate intake and increased risk for overall skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly in women (50). Overconsumption of folic acid may also increase risk of toxicity (51) and some cancers (52). Therefore, more research is needed to examine the relationships between folate levels, supplementation, and cancer risks or prevention. Several studies that evaluated folic acid in combination with other B vitamins reported negative findings, with no overall effect on breast or invasive cancers (33), along with the potential for increased cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease (34). Such interventions have also produced mixed results in studies for older adults with depression (53) (54), and did not improve bone mineral density (55) or reduce fracture risk or incidence (56) (69). Due to its antagonistic effects, folic acid can reduce the side effects of methotrexate when used for rheumatoid arthritis (22) (23). However, it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24) and psoriasis (25). Excess folate or folic acid may mask vitamin B12 deficiency (70).',\n",

Additional activities include the stimulation of antral contractions, reduction of postprandial antral area, and acceleration of gastric emptying (13). Ginger inhibits thromboxane formation and platelet aggregation (43). However, these effects appear to be dose- and formulation-dependent (eg, dried, fresh, or extract) (31). In vitro studies suggest that fresh ginger stimulates mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to combat viral infection (32), while certain ginger preparations reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial cells (8) and inhibited human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and c-Myc expression in human lung cancer cells (44). Gingerol induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through TRAIL-dependent caspase 3/7 activation (3) and inhibits cell-cycle progression by reducing cyclin D1 expression (4). It also inhibits secretion of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF and IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells (5). In animal models, shogaol reduces in vivo tumor growth by damaging microtubules and inducing mitotic arrest (3).

It is consumed for its perceived antioxidant and relaxant effects (12). Several in vitro and animal studies have shown that L-theanine has lipid-lowering (1), neuroprotective (2) (16), antiobesity (3), and antitumor (1) properties. It can also affect the levels of some neurotransmitters (10) (11), prevent beta-amyloid-induced cognitive dysfunction (13), and was shown to extend longevity in C. elegans (20). When combined with antipsychotic treatment, L-theanine alleviated anxiety and other related symptoms, and improved sleep in patients with schizophrenia (17) (21). In an open-label study of patients with major depressive disorder, L-theanine was safe and improved depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairments (29). Epidemiological data suggest its benefits with green tea for prevention of stroke (4), but it is unclear whether L-theanine contributed to this benefit. Small studies indicate that a combination of L-theanine and caffeine improves cognitive performance (14) (15), although behavior improvements observed with caffeine alone were lost with concomitant caffeine and L-theanine supplementation (22). L-theanine may help improve sleep quality in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (18). Theanine derivatives are currently being studied in models of human and mouse cancers for their inhibitory effects (23). L-theanine enhances the chemotherapeutic effects of doxorubicin (5) and idarubicin (6), and alleviates adverse effects from use of these agents both in vitro and in animal models (7) (24). However, patients undergoing chemotherapy should discuss the use of L-theanine with their physicians because these effects are not based on clinical trials, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea reduces activity of the chemotherapy drug bortezomib.',\n",

       " 'Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a natural indolecarbinol compound derived from the breakdown of glucobrassicin produced in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts (39). Some of the health-protective effects of I3C are attributed to epigenetic mechanisms such as the regulation of HDAC and HAT activities and acetylation of histones and non-histone chromatin proteins (63). Preliminary studies suggest several benefits to immune function. I3C counteracted immune evasion mechanisms of HPV16 by antagonizing E6 repression of E-cadherin (64). It decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T cell activation by acting as histone deacetylase class I (HDAC-I) inhibitors (31). Other anti-inflammatory mechanisms include regulation of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent signaling pathways (30). In cancer cells, I3C at higher doses (>400 μM) induced apoptosis, while lower doses (<200 μM) inihbited cell growth as well as cyclin E and CDK2 expression (27). It is among compounds that exert antiproliferative and/or proapoptotic effects through regulation of one or more microRNAs (miRNAs), short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or translation repression (65). I3C may act as a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer through its estrogen receptor (ER) modulating effect (15) or upregulation of apoptotic enzyme activities (48). It disrupted ER alpha-mediated transcription within IGF1 cascade cell signaling components (34), downregulated expression of estrogen-responsive genes pS2 and cathepsin-D, and upregulated BRAC1 (17). Other inhibitory mechanisms include suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/Sp1-mediated gene transcription, reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities, and decreasing aromatase expression (16) (36) (37). One randomized clinical trial suggests that the decreased risk of ER-sensitive breast and cervical cancers with I3C may be due to an increase in the 2-OH-estrone:estriol metabolite ratio (18). In HepG2 cells, I3C induced phase II and antioxidant enzymes (41). Other hepatoprotective mechanisms include immunomodulation and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (66). Acute hepatic inflammation was suppressed via decreased miR-31 expression and subsequent caspase-2-dependent apoptosis in T cells (32). In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, I3C significantly reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (12). In murine models, chemopreventive effects against lung tumors occurred via reductions in levels of proinflammatory and procarcinogenic proteins (44). In melanoma cells, I3C induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis by stabilization of PTEN that express wild-type PTEN (39). In prostate cancer cells, I3C inhibits androgen-dependent pathways and appeared to block the inflammatory microenvironment (38), and caused apoptosis by inhibiting Akt activation (8). I3C coadministration with doxorubicin potentiated cytotoxic effects compared with either agent alone in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (49). Chemosensitive effects were produced in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells via microRNA-21 downregulation (43). I3C also lowered the LD50 of gemcitabine and decreased growth of pancreatic cancer cells, possibly through reactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a (19). I3C with genistein produced synergy of apotosis and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in endometrial cancer cells (40). It reversed dexamethasone cytotoxicity via ROS inhibition and enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression (54). Some animal studies suggest that I3C is both an inhibitor and promoter of carcinogenesis with strong induction of placental glutathione S-transferase foci in the liver (57), and modulatory activity that included apoptotic inhibition in colon tumors (55). In addition, I3C may promote endometrial adenocarcinoma through hepatic CYP1 induction and estrogen metabolism modulation (56).',\n",

       " 'Lutein is a natural carotenoid pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Carotenoids are classified as either provitamin A (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, which can be converted into retinol) or nonprovitamin A (lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin). Lutein has antioxidant (1) (2) and anti-inflammatory (3) activities, and supplements are marketed as protection against ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and for general eye health. Dietary lutein may protect against DNA damage but this may be due to concomitant intake of other micronutrients (4). However, preliminary evidence suggests that supplemental lutein may reduce biomarkers for coronary vascular disease (CVD) in healthy nonsmokers (5), and increase serum lutein in patients with early atherosclerosis, thereby regulating serum lipids and reducing inflammatory cytokines (6). Epidemiologic studies also suggest an association between increased lutein consumption and decreased incidence of atherosclerosis (7) and cataracts (8) (9), although the effects of dietary lutein on macular degeneration are inconsistent (10) (11) (12). Other long-term studies found no effects with lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation on cognitive function (31), or risk for cataract surgery or vision loss (32) (33). Preliminary studies suggest lutein supplementation may increase plasma lutein concentrations and physical activity in sedentary older adults (34). It may also improve visual field in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (15). Other studies show increased macular pigment optical density (MPOD) with lutein-containing supplements in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (35), but not in healthy volunteers (36) or offspring of parents with neovascular AMD (37). Although lutein/zeaxanthin improved retinal function in patients with early AMD (38), the current evidence is insufficient to support its use (12) (13) (14). Increased lutein consumption may decrease the risk of renal cell carcinoma (16), nonaggressive urothelial cell carcinoma (17), and breast cancer (18). Data on the effects of dietary lutein intake and risk of cervical or colon cancer are conflicting (19) (20) (21) (22), whereas no association was found between lutein and lung cancer risk (23) or prostate cancer risk (39).',\n",

It is also required for synthesis of nucleic acid, notably DNA, the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in the mitochondria, and in delivering SAMe, the universal methyl donor (16) (30). In humans, two enzymatic reactions dependent on B12 are produced and activated in separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria (1). As a coenzyme in methyl transfer reactions, B12 converts homocysteine to methionine, and participates in L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion to succinyl-CoA (8). In the first enzyme reaction, methylcobalamin is used to recycle the folate cofactor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate thereby allowing the folate cofactor to participate in a cycle involving the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. During this reaction, homocysteine is converted to methionine yielding the methyl groups required for methylation that is essential in biosynthesis (31). When used with pemetrexed, B12/folic acid therapy further increases sub-G1 populations in human adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma cell lines, independent of p53 status (28).',\n",

Another C. indicum extract inhibited formation of TRAP-positive mature osteoclasts, disrupted bone resorption, and enhanced primary osteoblast differentiation via upregulation of alkaline phosphatase expression and extracellular calcium concentrations (25). A C. zawadskii ethanol extract inhbited osteoclastogenesis through suppression of ERK activation and other mechanisms to negatively regulate osteoclast differentiation. In diabetes-associated bone disease, C. zawadskii attenuation of dRib-induced cell damage in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells was attributed to antioxidant activity and effects on differentiation related to bone recovery (30). In animal models, handelin from C. boreale produced anti-inflammatory effects that were linked to downregulation of NF-kappaB signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (23).

       " 'Echinacea’s active constituents include cichoric and caftaric acids, polysaccharides, and alkylamides (47). Immune-modulating effects of a standardized echinacea root extract include upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6 (39). Immunemodulation by alkylamides occurs through binding to human cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and by inhibiting TNF-alpha (48). Alkylamides may also be responsible for anti-inflammatory effects (27). Although echinacea does not appear to have significant ergogenic or anabolizing effects, it appears to enhance the immune system and decrease oxidative damage (49). In vitro and in vivo, echinacea extracts were shown to stimulate phagocytosis, enhance mobility of leukocytes, stimulate TNF and IL-1 secretion from macrophages and lymphocytes, and improve respiratory activity (2) (3). However, their effects on innate immunity such as phagocytosis could not be confirmed, and showed only minimal effects on tumor progression, although echinacea did stimulate natural killer cell activity (50). Other studies suggest that bacterial components of echinacea are responsible for immune benefits, as total bacterial load differences and content of bacterial lipopolysaccharides within echinacea samples have correlated with NF-kappaB activation in THP-1 cells (51). In human colon cancer cells, cichoric acid decreased telomerase activity and induced apoptosis via DNA fragmentation, caspase-9 activation, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and beta-catenin downregulation (42). Differential effects of echinacea on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activities may be due to systemic unavailability of locally-acting constituents that inhibit CYP3A, or rapid absorption of these constituents that limits intestinal exposure and CYP3A induction, or a systemically-formed constituent metabolite that is capable of inducing hepatic but not intestinal CYP3A (52).',\n",

They are marketed as dietary supplements to treat hot flashes, high cholesterol, and for cancer prevention. Isoflavones exhibit both selective estrogen receptor modulator activity and non-hormonal effects. Studies of soy for menopausal symptoms are inconclusive (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9). While some trials indicate slower bone density loss (10) (11) (91), others report no such effects in postmenopausal women (12) (13). But there may be cardiovascular benefits (17), as soy reduces low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (14) (15) along with having beneficial effects on blood pressure in postmenopausal women (16) (97) and in healthy adults (90). A meta-analysis confirmed that consumption of soy leads to reductions in both total cholesterol and LDL in adults (99). Soy intake also reduced proteinuria in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy (19). However, conflicting data suggest no protective effects against diabetes (20). Other studies of soy did not find benefit for Alzheimer’s disease (92) or for poorly controlled asthma (93), but soy isoflavone supplementation alone or with Vitamin D improved some symptoms and quality of life in patients with irritable bowel disease (94); and lactobacillus-fermented soybean was found to enhance cognitive function in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (100). In a study of chronic stroke patients, ingesting soymilk immediately following rehabilitation exercise was reported to improve functional outcomes (101); soymilk consumption along with a low-calorie diet had beneficial effects on some metabolic parameters in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (102). Soy has been investigated for its anticancer effects as well. Data show that it may reduce the risk of prostate (21) (22) (23), lung (24) (80), and endometrial (25) (26) cancers, but increase risk of bladder cancer (27) and endometrial hyperplasia (28). It may prolong survival among women with lung cancer (81), reduce mortality (89) and breast cancer recurrence regardless of tamoxifen use (42), or prevent breast cancer (29) (30). However, long-term supplementation did not affect mammographic density in breast cancer patients or in high-risk women (95) and other data suggest adverse effects (31) (32) or that supplementation can stimulate over-expression of breast cancer genes in patients with invasive breast cancer (87). Preclinical findings indicate that soy consumption may increase metastasis (33); and daidzin-rich extracts can promote ER-positive breast cancer growth (88). Genistein, the most estrogenic isoflavone (34), has been reported to improve fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance in postmenopausal women (18). It also demonstrated antiproliferative effects in multiple cell lines, including breast cancer (ER+/-) (35), prostate cancer (androgen-dependent/-independent) (36), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (37), neuroblastoma, sarcoma, and retinoblastoma cells (36). However, animal studies show that it antagonizes the effects of tamoxifen (38) (39) and promotes tumor progression in advanced prostate cancer (40). In addition, supplementation may decrease serum PSA levels in prostate cancer patients before (41), but not after (82), prostatectomy. Further research is needed to evaluate the role of genistein in cancer prevention. Isoflavone supplementation may reduce side effects associated with chemo- or radiotherapy (43) (44), but when used with vitamin E and selenium, did not prevent prostate cancer progression (45). It was also ineffective in reducing hot flashes in patients with prostate cancer (83).

It negatively regulates vascular calcification and osteogenic differentiation through an increase or restoration of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) activity and increased expression of anticalcification proteins, in vitro (45). It also influences blood pressure levels through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system, by acting as a calcium channel blocker to reduce vascular resistance, and by modulating vascular tone and reactivity (46) (47). Further, it contributes to the homeostasis of electrolytes in cells via sodium-potassium pump activation (47) and can revert impaired intracellular ion homeostasis (25). As a cofactor of all reactions involving ATP transfer, magnesium is a major determinant of insulin and glucose metabolism, critical to carbohydrate metabolism, and regulates the activity of all enzymes involved in phosphorylation reactions (48). These vascular and metabolic mechanisms are echoed by observed relationships between deficiency and oxidative stress, proinflammatory states, endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia (48) (49). A possible mechanism of cardiovascular benefits may be via a reduction in arterial stiffness (76). Magnesium can also serve an immunomodulatory function by regulating NF-kB activation and cytokine production, and limiting systemic inflammation (50). It also reduces markers for systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein (4) (51). Its salts are poorly absorbed, and act as an osmotic laxative by retaining water in the intestine. The mechanism by which it may affect the bioavailability of concomitantly administered drugs is through the formation of insoluble chelate complexes with those drugs, substantially reducing their bioavailability (52). Experimental and epidemiological evidence for the role of magnesium in cancer is conflicting. Its part in cellular metabolism and maintaining genetic stability, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection against insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation are also cancer-preventive attributes (18) (19). At the same time, hypomagnesemia as a side effect of some cancer treatments may produce an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and neo-angiogenesis, but magnesium levels are also increased in tumors both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its multiple and possibly dichotomous roles in cancer (53) (54).',\n",

Similar statements have been released by the American Cancer Society, the World Cancer Research Institute in association with the American Institute for Cancer Research, and the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer ( 1470 ).\",\n",

Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium ( 13382 ). Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or \"hard\" water, is also a source of magnesium. Dietary intake of magnesium may be low, particularly among women ( 8088 , 12504 , 12505 ). Magnesium deficiency is not uncommon in the US. It\\'s particularly prevalent among African Americans and the elderly. Low intake and impaired absorption of magnesium have also been associated with the development of various disease states such as osteoporosis, hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and stroke ( 8088 , 8099 , 8998 , 9001 , 12510 , 12511 ).',\n",

It is taken orally as a carminative to treat digestive problems, applied topically as a counter-irritant for aches and cold symptoms, and its essential oil is used in aromatherapy. Peppermint is also widely used to flavor candies and oral hygiene products. Both extracts and essential oil derived from peppermint demonstrated antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant (35), antibacterial (36) (37), antifungal (38), antidiabetic (47) and antifibrotic (48) effects in preclinical studies. Clinical data indicate effectiveness of topical peppermint oil for alleviating headaches (1); oral peppermint oil for irritable bowel syndrome (4) (5); and oral peppermint oil, tea, and extracts for dyspepsia, gastric spasm, and general gastrointestinal discomfort (7) (33) (39). Pre-treatment with peppermint oil capsules was also found effective in decreasing pain and in reducing colonic spasms in patients during colonoscopy (34); and conclusions from a meta analysis indicate peppermint oil to be safe and effective against pain and global symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (40). Preliminary data suggest benefits of oral peppermint oil in modulating cognitive performance (43). Inhaling peppermint oil may also confer benefits. In a study of postoperative cardiac surgery patients, it was reported useful in controlling nausea (41), but conflicting findings suggest aromatherapy to be only as effective as a placebo for relief of postoperative nausea (45); and for nausea and vomiting in pregnant women (46). An exhaustive systematic review revealed low-quality evidence to support use of peppermint for postoperative nausea and vomiting (42). Peppermint has also been studied for possible anticancer effects. A significant anti-tumorigenic potential was observed against several human cancer cell lines (10) (11). Studies in animal models indicate peppermint’s effectiveness against radiation-induced testicular damage (12); benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung carcinogenicity (13) (14); and preventive effects against tobacco-induced carcinogenesis (15).
